 This is The Guardian. The Metropolitan Police open an investigation into goings-on in Downing Street while the Prime Minister's allies claim he was ambushed by a birthday cake. I'm Heather Stewart, political editor of The Guardian, and this is Politics Weekly. So, since he acknowledges the Minister of Code applies to him, will he now resign? It's been yet another dramatic week in Westminster, with fresh allegations of lockdown parties in Downing Street emerging as we wait with bated breath for the findings of Sue Grey's inquiry. Boris Johnson's defenders have been resorting to ever more desperate excuses, with one minister, Conor Burns, claiming a birthday sing-song was effectively an ambush. And what I can tell you this morning is that as a result, firstly of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team, and secondly my officer's own assessment, I can confirm that the Met is now investigating a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall. The Metropolitan Police have decided to investigate some of the numerous Downing Street parties, which they'd previously refused to do. We take these allegations extremely seriously. I took them very seriously when they were raised with me 18 months ago. Very glad there's an investigation taking place now. Away from partygate, the Prime Minister was forced to order an inquiry on Monday after a former Tory Minister went public with allegations that she was told her Muslimness had contributed to her sacking. So what's next? That's all in this week's Politics Weekly. Apologies to our listeners if it seems like we're talking about number 10 parties every week at the moment. The revolutions simply won't stop. And now the police are involved, so to try and get to grips with what exactly is happening, I'm joined by Guardian columnist and host of Politics Weekly Extra, Jonathan Friedland. Jonathan, on Tuesday we had this extraordinary news, didn't we, that the Metropolitan Police are now looking into events in Downing Street. How did you think that sort of changes Boris Johnson's position? Well, in any normal world there would be a huge thunderbolt out of the sky that would often fell a Prime Minister. Just to be under police investigation would be such a mark of cane on a political leader that it would be hard to recover from it. So bizarre has this story become that in a strange way it was greeted by some conservatives almost as good news because they thought it meant they could draw this out and stretch it out much longer because you know how they for the last few weeks been able to say, well we can't talk about that, we've got to wait for Sue Grey. Well this would now give them a new one, which is, well obviously I can't say anything about that because it's the subject of a police investigation and as we know police investigations take a long time. So I think there were some who thought, okay well this gets it into the long grass and maybe the police will only report you know in May or something and they can say well all that's in the past. So I think you and I are both old enough to remember a time where a Prime Minister being under police investigation would in and of itself be catastrophic and yet Boris Johnson is in so deep that it hasn't played on their side at least quite like that. He's in so deep and also he's someone who doesn't play by the sort of accepted rules of politics or the sort of accepted constraints of the Constitution isn't he? I mean I had colleagues asking me yesterday you know surely he'll have to resign, well of course you know as you say in any sort of normal world you might have thought he would but he's not that man is he? I think that's completely right. I mean I wonder if he's actually about Donald Trump just saying never underestimate the power of a man with no shame because if you're not embarrassed and if you don't feel shame then that puts you in a pretty strong position because where other people would just be mortified by the idea of being under police investigation and they would walk. That wasn't the case with Donald Trump and it's not the case with Boris Johnson so the usual idea that you can rely on norms or conventions or of gentleman's agreements I don't think it's like that with him and just as it was with Trump you actually have to look at the law if you're going to think about what might push somebody out and it turns out the law is actually only as strong as the people who enforce it which in this case might well end up being outside the police investigation just end up being his own MPs. Well then that gives you a lot of power if you're Boris Johnson if you're ready to brazen it out and so far that has seemed to be his mode. And Jonathan I've just rushed upstairs to the Guardian's Westminster office from the chamber the House of Commons chamber where I was watching Prime Minister's questions and it was very clear from that I think from Johnson's performance what his approach is going to be it certainly is brazening out isn't it and it's also pointing to lots of other you know achievements of his government and things they want to be allowed to get on with and sort of suggesting that by continuing to press the questions about parties and so on Labour's you know just sort of trying to score political points. We're launching a plan tomorrow Mr Speaker to get half a million people off welfare into work it's a fantastic idea I hope he supports it. Yeah I think and he's taking his cue I think the Prime Minister from that front page of the Daily Mail they did a front page suggesting the nation's lost all sense of proportion because really what we should be talking about is Ukraine and Boris Johnson went on that as if trying to again shame Keir Starmer. He talks about the most serious issue before the public today and before the world today it's almost as though he was in ignorance of the fact Mr Speaker that we have a crisis on the borders of Ukraine. As if look here you are obsessing about cake and birthday parties when there are big things afoot so of course you should stop bothering me about the these minor matters and be and let me be the big statesman talking about Ukraine on its face it works quite well because obviously a war in Ukraine is a bigger deal than having a slice of cake but the counter argument is of course it's not about cake it's about this much bigger principle which is that you everybody is subject to the law and those who write the rules have to abide by them and indeed there have been some conservative commentators around and about this week saying that is the principle that's at stake even in Ukraine actually it's a basic tenet of democracy that you have to be the leaders must be subject to the same rules as though they lead but yeah superficially it gives it was an attempt by Boris Johnson amazingly to have a bit of moral high ground and say I'm the terribly serious man and you Kierstama are obsessed with trivia I think in terms of their two respective brands most people think it's sort of the other way around. But sitting there watching it it did appear to be working at least superficially with conservative MPs or those who had turned up so unlike some recent weeks a lot of them had turned up it seemed to me to support Boris Johnson they were very very noisy it's one of the things you realise when you're actually in there from watching it on TV is that it's even noisier than it appears and I thought the Tory benches were in particularly loud this week there's a lot of shouting there's a lot of banging of benches a lot of yelling of more when you know Boris Johnson made one of these points I mean of course doesn't necessarily mean that those very same people might not be considering sending in a letter calling for a vote of no confidence but there is at least some sense of a public show of support for him by conservative MPs isn't there? Yes and I think his own performance sort of reflected that he was more high energy he didn't do that downbeat crestfallen look that you and I will both remember from that interview with Beth Rigby a few days back where he looked absolutely downcast he was instead giving it high energy and he can do that but yeah I mean the people behind him you really wouldn't want to trust that as any kind of indicator again showing my age I do remember even as Tories were plotting the downfall of Margaret Thatcher they were full-throatedly shouting their support and waving their order papers for her in the House of Commons I think they even did it straight after they defenestrated her too I mean they you know the the Tory in public and the Tory in private are two very different animals and yes they put on a show today and that will I think at least you know give pause to some of the plotters wondering whether they have the numbers but yeah I think it was a show rather than anything anything more. And Jonathan we've seen quite different approaches when it comes to that from his potential rivals haven't we so Liz Truss who is seen as one sort of one of the front runners if there were a leadership race to be triggered she's very much gone for she keeps saying it herself in fact 100 supports the Prime Minister she was sitting there very close to him today you know she's been very very defensive of him where she's Sunak another potential contender a little bit more a little bit quieter I would say and and not so much out there on the media defending him. Completely right and I think that's an interesting difference of who's looking at the party and who's looking at the party meaning conservative party rather than birthday party and who's looking at the country so I think Liz Truss is thinking I don't get this job unless Tories vote for me and they will reward loyalty to Boris Johnson a lot of them will feel angry that Boris Johnson if he goes was driven out by the liberal media and so on I think Rishi Sunak might be thinking having one eye on assuming he gets the job on persuading the country that he's something different and he's not tainted by the man he hopes would be his predecessor and so I thought that was that is my reading of the difference since we're talking about public performance I do notice how very absent Michael Gove is fellow bus rider and campaigner in the famous Brexit campaign of 2016 famously again you know stabbed Boris Johnson in the front attacking him just when there was that Tory leadership election you don't hear much from him either and that too has crossed my mind but yeah I think your reading of the difference in trust and Sunak is really striking. And Jonathan we don't yet as we speak have this the sort of fabled as it is now Sue Grey report do we we've all been waiting and Johnson's line for some weeks now has been I can't possibly comment on this we need to wait for Sue Grey that's the senior civil servant to do this to carry out her work to investigate these gatherings that may or may not have happened in lockdown in parliament we're still waiting for that aren't we how much difference does that make when it comes or do you think we're sort of past that point now that we know that she have found enough evidence to pass it on to the Met and trigger a police investigation? Well it actually the answer that does depend on what's in it because if that's all it says then you're right there's no hard news in it because we already got that in a way from Cressida Dick yesterday the commissioner of the Met saying exactly that and also the Met spelling out what the criteria were for making the judgment they've made and I notice Keir Starmer deliberately unpacked that. The police spelt out that what they meant by that that those involved you or ought to have known what they were doing was an offence? So yeah if it's only that then you're right but if there is you know who knows a new party that we didn't know about some other much more smoking gun you know that actually puts him in the room perhaps at an occasion where we didn't know he was in the room or even if very very coded some sort of hint of what she herself thinks of what Boris Johnson has done and I've been told by one former Mandarin that you what you want to look for are the juxtapositions meaning what facts does Sugre choose to put side by side in the report? She won't deliver a judgment she's not in that role that's not her remit she won't say guilty or innocent but if she puts two facts alongside each other that show clearly what Keir Starmer actually was driving at today that for example the prime minister misled parliament you know two statements on December 1st he said this on x-date he did this and almost inviting the reader inviting those MPs to see that therefore he misled parliament well that could be very damaging indeed so that's a that requires a bit of between the lines reading but not much and there may be some of that so you know we're not just waiting for Godot it could actually deliver and you know but as yet as you and I speak we don't know. And sort of playing out what might possibly happen you could then do you think get a scenario in which there were enough letters put into Graham Brady the chair of the 1922 committee 54 is the is the threshold we could could we get a situation in which a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson is triggered and were he to to lose that he would be out wouldn't he? Yeah that's the sequence you know at the moment one doesn't get the feeling that the rebels are terrifically well organized and it's you know has been a little bit chaotic and so you wonder if there could be a lot of anger and yet somehow it doesn't find its outlet because they they just sort of cock it up I wouldn't rule that out. But if there is something that is you know not quite a smoking gun but a smoking juxtaposition on the lines I was saying that may even overcome the lack of organization of the rebels if there is a wave of I wouldn't say disgust I don't think that you know frankly they've given all they've seen I don't think you'd be wise to look for moral outrage on the Tory side you know they haven't been outraged yet but rather if they look at it and go there is no way I'm going to be able to explain that to my constituents that's the calculation that would do him in otherwise you know yeah it's possible that he fights on it was very helpful for him that Sue Gray hadn't delivered the report ahead of 12 noon today it would have been really hard for him I think it made things much easier for him to have a PMQ where he could just wheel out the line we still don't know you know vaccine rollout subject verb vaccine rollout that's his favorite sentence. Yeah I think that's right and we've seen lots of public appearances haven't we in recent weeks where he's I mean he's visited an awful lot of hospitals and vaccination centers and so on because he's obviously hoping to sort of recapture that mood of last spring isn't he where the conservatives were riding fairly high in the polls and partly because everybody was feeling so relieved to be you know coming out of lockdown and here was this vaccine which was going to sort of save us all is there a sense he's a great political fighter isn't he and he's known for being able to sort of withstand and come back from blows that other politicians just wouldn't is there a scenario in which he somehow gets through this he fights on and his popularity somehow regains his popularity do you think or is this is he toast really? Well because it's him you wouldn't yet want to sort of pass the or I'll say the last rights for Boris Johnson politically yet because because he is able to wriggle out of things and he's got I think you know the amoral gift which is he knows no shame and I think that has spread actually I think the a lot of the conservative MPs who would once have been shamed by being led by such a man are no longer capable of being shamed so that means I think it's very you know it is plausible he soldiers on at least until May if they get absolutely you know shellacked in these elections in May then that you may see some of this reopen and as I say it depends a bit what the police find and it very much does depend on what Sue Grey finds but yeah there is a scenario in which she carries on and they say vaccine rollout and Ukraine and they just hope the media and you've seen the Daily Mail already out there and others say look there's other things and time to get on. And do you think Labour in a way would be quite relieved if he does sort of struggle on I wonder what you what you make of how Keir Starmer has been playing these last few weeks? There is something about the very relaxed stance and sort of tenor of Keir Starmer's questions in the last two or three weeks. The guy that said in hindsight in our appreciation it was a party. We've discovered the real captain hindsight haven't we Mr Speaker? Yeah. Where people have been saying that there's a lot of pressure on him if it's an open goal there's pressure on the striker to score he has looked very relaxed to me more than normal and I think that's because he feels he's in a win-win here which is it's a win for him if Boris Johnson goes he got the scalp he removed Victoria Prime Minister but if he leaves an injured limping Prime Minister who yes has the command of his MPs but out there in the country is sort of a joke figure and he's no longer trusted you know and and I noticed the sheer nerve of the Prime Minister using the saying that this government is trusted he then went on to say trusted to deliver but you know you'd think he would avoid that word but no if they if if Keir Starmer thinks that there's Boris Johnson limping ahead who will forever be associated in the public mind with breaking rules he set for everyone else well that's a very beatable opponent at a future general election so I wonder if Keir Starmer's to my mind newly relaxed demeanor suggests someone who thinks win-win yeah I think you might be right somebody said to me recently who's in his sort of close team that he's he's really started to enjoy being Labour leader in a way that he he hadn't I think up to now I think it had been a bit of a slog and I think yeah I think that's right and he was sort of making little quips at pmq's today which I think he didn't used to do did he I mean those little off the cuff things I mean I noticed he didn't do one of the big blockbuster emotional questions you know mentioning the Queen on her own or reading a letter from a constituent who couldn't celebrate the birthday of a dying relative or or something of that nature even though other MPs have been doing that on social media and so on he wanted Boris Johnson on the record saying that if he had misled parliament yes he would have to resign and he got that and even though there were no fireworks with that I thought to myself maybe that's what he came for and he got it and so again you know he wins if he gets that he wins if he gets a big emotional charge either way it kind of works for him yeah Boris Johnson tried to tell him at one stage that he was a lawyer not a leader but you wonder whether at the point at which you've got the Prime Minister being investigated by the police perhaps what you want is a is a lawyerist leader of the leader of the opposition I thought that was such a risky line for Boris Johnson because I have and I can say I thought of it straight away because I did I tweeted the second I'd heard it if I was kissed I would have got up and said don't knock lawyers Prime Minister pretty soon you might need one you might need one yeah you know because because yeah I thought it was it was playing with fire but that's partly what the tour is like about Boris Johnson is he is there's a sort of air of danger about him which he takes risks he says things that make you go is that going to work and it was the same thing by the way and I make this comparison often I know but with with Donald Trump that is partly what makes certain types of politicians I'm not saying I admire this but it does make them compelling because you think what are they about to do you know that is not something you ever thought with Theresa May you know that there was there was no hint of danger about her performance with is she going to go off beast and say something risky and I thought you know even mentioning tax cutting when actually this is a government putting out national insurance which Boris Johnson did he praised his own government as a tax cutting government that was trusted and you think no that's not what it is at all but the sheer kind of chutzpah of it would you know give fired up someone on his own side absolutely it's it's certainly not boring and I don't think it's going to become boring anytime soon Jonathan Frieden thanks ever so much thank you Heather on Friday's episode of politics weekly extra Jonathan will be talking to our colleague Julian Borja about what exactly is happening in Ukraine and how Joe Biden is approaching the potential for war with Russia listen out for that and make sure to listen back to Monday and Wednesday's episodes of today and focus and the team give us more insight into what's been a disastrous time for Boris Johnson after the break we look into the recent allegations of Islamophobia in the conservative party we'll be right back welcome back to politics weekly I'm Heather Stewart former conservative minister Nuzrat Gani revealed at the weekend that she was told her muslimness had made conservative party colleagues uncomfortable and that had contributed to her sacking in 2020 under pressure Boris Johnson ordered an inquiry oh good another inquiry I spoke to the guardians community affairs correspondent Amna Modine to hear more hi Amna it's good to have you on thank you so much for having me on Heather it's been a very very hectic few weeks hasn't it it has in one way or another I mean in a way this is a story that's almost at risk of getting lost in the the sort of maelstrom this week but the former transport minister Nuzrat Gani gave a pretty extraordinary interview to the Sunday Times at the weekend didn't she and made some shocking allegations yes she did it was really really shocking in her interview Nuzrat Gani said that the government whip told her that her and I quote muslimness was raised as an issue during discussions about the 2020 reshuffle now during this reshuffle she was sacked as her job as a transport minister and when she was sacked she said her status and again I quote as a muslim woman was making colleagues uncomfortable and Amna we should say that chief whip mark Spencer has admitted he was the person Nuzrat Gani spoken to but he's denied having said the remarks she attributed to him so she's evidently tried to raise this with the party before she went to Boris Johnson and she was told to make a complaint within the party's internal complaints process which for obvious reasons she felt was inappropriate largely because you know she said this was government business so the internal complaints process is quite similar to other parties you know a complainant comes forward makes the allegation it's promptly investigated and the decision is taken shortly afterwards but the complaints process within the conservative party has long been dogged with accusations that it's not fit for purpose in august 2020 young conservatives in wales went to the press to urge the party to reform its complaints process and they were citing a lack of clarity and transparency and it was worth noting that an independent inquiry last year into the conservative party handling of discrimination kind of said that there was clear evidence that the complaint system was in need of overhaul so you know with that being said it's no wonder she had no interest in going down that path. Yeah it does seem understandable doesn't it? Did the conservative party do anything to clean up its complaint system after there was that as you say this is this report chaired by professor Swaran Singh and it did find there were problems with the complaints process is there any sense that anything's changed because what one of the things ministers were saying over the weekend again what to her was perhaps you'd like to take this up with the with the party? Yeah from what we understand and from speaking to muslim tories the party accepted the recommendation that was made from the Singh inquiry but very little has happened or very little change has taken place and it's worth noting that this inquiry was described as a complete whitewash from the people who kind of called for it and while the review said that anti-muslim sentiment remains a problem it didn't find any evidence of institutional racism and that came as a huge shock to muslim tories and human rights groups. So is there a sense that there is a problem in the party then Amna it sounds as though you know we've spoken to other people over the years who've also raised these issues? Yes definitely you know Sayidawasi is the most famous for coming forward and accusing the party of Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination so this is almost 10 years in the making where every now and then someone comes forward and says there's huge issues within the party and people feel very little has been done so it's no wonder that huge groups now are turning towards the equality and human rights office commission to ask them to intervene. Yeah and of course the equality and human rights commission did look into labor and its handling of anti-semitism complaints didn't it and made a pretty damning report and of course the difference there is that it's sort of on a statutory footing and so when it makes recommendations parties are obliged to do something about it so after initially saying she needs to go through the party process the tories did make a move didn't they and they've now said they will carry out a cabinet office inquiry into the specific allegations that Nuz Raghani made. Yes exactly so in quite a brief statement from number 10 they said the cabinet office will investigate the facts of the case, labor followed through to say you know we need to see if the ministerial code was broken in response Gani herself said that she wants to see the terms of reference for any inquiry and she wants it to include everything that was said in down the street and by the whip but cabinet sources are telling the guardian that the matter is going to be investigated through a standard process using the ethics team and there might be a possibility where they'll look at whether the ministerial code has been broken but it doesn't seem to be anything that's going to be much more significant I'm not really sure it's going to meet what people are asking for. No and for those of us who sort of keen Westminster watchers this is the same process of course that is is often used to look at ministers who may or may not have done something wrong or in fact it's pretty similar it's cabinet office it's the same bit of government that's looking into partygate of course and you know the point about it is it's not really an independent inquiry it's a bit of government and ultimately the person who decides who looks at the report and decides whether anything needs to be done about it is of course Boris Johnson and in the case of for example pretty Patel who was found to have behaved in a way that could constitute bullying albeit perhaps unintentionally. Boris Johnson decided that wasn't a resigning matter and stood behind her and kept her on you know what one can see why Nazareth Ghani might feel that something broader would be better or more independent perhaps. Amna as you say it doesn't really tackle this sense that there's a wider problem with Islamophobia here does it? No definitely and it's no wonder really that after the huge pressure that's been piled on the Equality and Human Rights Commission they intervened to say that if this inquiry they're not satisfied with it they will use their legal powers to intervene and investigate. As I was saying before you know there's a real fear that a lot of this issues around Islamophobia is sanctioned from the top you know you've spoken quite a lot about some of the comments that the Prime Minister's made and other senior conservatives and this is where their claim is where the Singh inquiry was a white wash comes from you know that an apology was seen as enough we're making those comments and people say you know if the leader of the party and the government is allowed to say these things of course then in a much more local and grassroots level they're going to be allowed to say and do what they want it's almost sanctioned from the top the fear. Yeah absolutely and the Chief Whipp is of course a very close ally of the Prime Minister and you know no doubt she would have felt he was he was speaking for the Prime Minister in those conversations that she alleges to have taken place. Alright Amna it seems to me like something we definitely shouldn't lose sight of in all the other sort of chaos that's going on this week and Amna do you feel that Islamophobia is a broader issue in politics? Oh definitely you know I think a lot of Labour MPs have come forward in the past few months to speak about their own issues of Islamophobia. A lot of it is to do with some of the emails that they get and some of the abuse that they see on Twitter and when they speak out they feel like the response that they get is marred with Islamophobia so this is definitely not just a conservative issue this is an issue within all parties and frankly across British society. Amna Modine thanks very much. Thank you. And that's all from us this week I want to thank our guests on an incredibly busy week in Westminster Jonathan Friedland and Amna Modine.
