 This is The Guardian. Hi there, it's Jonathan Friedland, host of Politics Weekly Extra from The Guardian. I hope you're having a good holiday season, you've got your feet up, perhaps eating far too much and generally having a well-earned rest. We at the podcast are taking a break ourselves. After all, enough happened in 2021 in US politics to exhaust anyone. But we'll be back on January 7th with analysis of all the latest in politics in Washington, DC and beyond. I hope you'll join us then and throughout 2022. But for now, here's to a happy and peaceful new year.
