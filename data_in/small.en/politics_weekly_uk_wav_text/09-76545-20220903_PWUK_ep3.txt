 This is The Guardian. More than two million Ukrainian refugees have now fled their country. It's the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Many here in the UK feel Britain should be doing more to help. Even some Tory MPs are baffled and angry. This is a disgrace. When the minister leaves his dispatch box, he'll ask them to go back to the home coffins and tell them to get a grip. Yay, this is the case of oil and gas overnight, even from Russia. That's obviously not something that every country around the world can do. What the Prime Minister said there highlights familiar hostility on the right to the government's net zero target for carbon emissions and his apparently weakening support of it. As ever, there's lots to talk about. I'm John Harris and you're listening to Politics Weekly UK for The Guardian. Joining me today are The Guardian columnists Raphael Bear and Zoe Williams. Hello to you both. Hello, John. Hello. Before we look at what is happening in Ukraine and how it's playing out in the UK, I wanted to ask you both about President Zelensky's speech to parliament on Tuesday. Zoe, you wrote about this for The Guardian. I did. I mean, in the moment, I did think it was incredibly poignant because the language was very pared down. It was extremely stripped out of rhetoric or flourish until the end. It was just a really bold description of the 13 days up to that point. I thought it was devastating. Yeah, I came to it backwards in a way because I didn't watch it live because I had a deadline. I caught up with it on the radio this morning and so I had it preceded by a lot of the political commentary which sort of prepared me to feel slightly sort of jaundiced and cynical about everything in the MPs and what was going on in the House of Commons. I was sort of detached from it. And then it slightly caught me by surprise how moved I was actually by it. I was out walking my dog listening to it on headphones and I found myself actually properly moved because I wasn't expecting that at all. It slightly took me back. I don't know whether this is too crass a way of looking at it, but I suppose one could feel one or two things or both at once actually, which is that it was an affirmation of the fact however damaged and compromised our democracy is. We have common cause with him in some way and there's something very moving in that or and or you could take it as the fact that there was a sort of shaming aspect implicitly to it somewhat given some of the foot dragging on actions related to Ukraine that the government's done and perhaps some of the positioning of particular MPs. I think it was the former certainly that that had the sort of guts, the visceral impact on me, just thinking just you know you can in our game in particular in journalism you can get quite jaded and your nerves can get dulled to horror and for some reason he did manage to cut through that and and just the sheer scale of what is going on and as you say the fact that he was addressing parliament and there was a moment of democratic solidarity one way or another I felt that transmitted actually I was quite impressed. So judging by what you wrote you sort of fell that side of it as well. The thing is is that you know MPs aren't meant to clap in the House of Commons, I'm sure you two both know that better than I do. They do occasionally don't they? I only remembered it yesterday but there was something about the sight of them all kind of standing up and giving him that ovation both when he started and when he finished that was kind of, it was actually quite, it really really rammed home the gravity of the situation you know. You saw them as human beings as well which is incredibly unfamiliar to look at the Tory front bench at least and think oh those are also frightened human beings. By PMQs they were all back to being exactly as kind of performative and ridiculous and dishonest as they always are. So I mean I would be careful not to overstate the kind of common cause and soul maitre of British parliamentarians and Volodymyr Zelensky. I think it did exactly what you said actually John that it kind of made you, there was an implied devastation in it that he's having to explain at all that they're people just like us and this suffering is completely unwarranted that you know it's, to have to explain that to another country it's a kind of painful thing, I'm painful to watch. It was beautifully put. Now what we're going to look at today are the government's confused and some would say disgraceful response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis and how Britain and other countries are moving away from reliance on Russian oil and gas and the question of the government's net zero target, net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and where that stands now. Let's talk about refugees to start with. The United Nations has announced that more than two million people fled Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion and we all know that the government is on the end of all sorts of criticism for what seems to be a mixture of sort of stubbornness and nastiness and also a high level of incompetence. So far I mean the numbers are moving all the time but the numbers of visas granted to Ukrainian refugees by Britain numbers disgracefully in the hundreds whereas other countries are well into the thousands and there's just the plain fact that we are requiring a visa when the countries of the EU are not right next to us in fact geographically is one of those Ireland. Pretty Patel earlier this week raised the prospect of a new humanitarian route for refugees from Ukraine which down the street then seemed to rule out. Then Pretty Patel said that a bespoke visa application center had been set up en route to Calais, I don't know quite what that means because obviously if you're in Johannesburg Cairo is en route to Calais but it doesn't mean very much before clarifying that the work was not complete yet and there was that very memorable image of a sort of trestle table somewhere in the region of Calais with some crisps on it. Speaking on Tuesday her opposite number the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper powerfully I thought laid out the dismal government response to Ukrainian refugees. Most people want to stay close to home but some want to come here to join family or friends and we should be helping them instead most people are still being held up by home office bureaucracy or being turned away. Yesterday the home secretary told the house twice that a visa center en route to Calais has now been set up but it still doesn't exist. That was powerful authentic stuff I thought watching that. Well yeah it's interesting also when Yvette Cooper is a true politician as well as someone who I think cares strongly about these things and has in the past taken more form of a better word conservative line on issues of migration when that has been something that's been problematic for the Labour Party and clearly she feels among other things that the public is very much on her side on this one and that came across also in some of the interventions we had from conservative MPs talking about their constituents and sounding you know to the untrained ear like irate lefty liberals about this in or as would have been not that long ago which is a sign I think of just the fact that the just a moral imperative of this question has blasted a lot of the what we would have expected the political structures and the shape of the arguments have been just out of the water because we're talking about a different reality now. I mean whether it's specifically left liberal irateness or not irateness is the obvious response the most visceral natural automatic response to all this. I mean you see these things popping up all the time Zoe our colleague Amelia Gentlemen the brilliant Guardian reporter was on Twitter earlier on talking about the the family of a former London bus driver called Jakob Voloshuk and they were twice detained detained by UK border of force officials at Calais they made eight trips to the UK visa center in Paris two trips to the British consulate and one trip to the UK embassy before finally being allowed to travel to the UK and these people have come out of a fear of war I mean it's unimaginable it's it's completely unimaginable and right at the moment Johnson has two lines one is that he the number is uncapped and it could be you know he is not expecting it to be anything less than the hundred numbers in the hundreds of thousands but how that actually works when they can't get themselves together to get more than 300 people out in 13 days just makes no sense to me I just don't understand if you're going to kind of erect these layers of bureaucracy whether it's a humanitarian visa or a family visa I don't understand how they expect to get numbers of refugees in any amount the other line which Johnson is coming out with really really constantly at the moment is that the UK has settled more vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015 now this is bollocks it's they've said the UK has settled more under the resettlement scheme which is about 25,000 I think the nearest is Sweden but the resettlement scheme is a tiny tiny fraction of the actual number of refugees right so all this is meant is that everybody from Ian Blackfield of the SMP to the BBC is just constantly producing numbers of how far we're falling short compared to the rest of Europe and it's really really chilling like like a lot of people there's a certain bafflement in one's response to this like how can this be allowed to happen and I wanted to get into maybe trying to begin to answer that now moving through parliament at the moment this seems to me to be the sort of central point of relevance is the government's nationality and borders bill last week the House of Lords struck down some parts of the bill what they struck down among other things were parts of the bill that essentially said that if you came here as a refugee via an irregular route which is to say if you pitch up here without having been to a visa application centre then you stood a good chance of falling foul of the law and even go to prison now that was that was struck down and we don't know now what the government response to that is going to be and whether they want to revive that part or those parts of the bill but that you know up until this point was very clearly its stance on refugees and it seems to me that in the government's mind in its own sort of nasty awful way might be the thought that if you go the way of the EU on your openness to Ukrainian refugees and the logic that sits under that legislation and the government's entire stance on questions of refugees and asylum then then were gone yeah I think it's it's interesting first of all it's worth pointing out that the why the Lord struck that particular clause out of the bill I mean apart from the fact they were generally appalled by it but also it's a pretty direct contravention of I think the 1951 convention on refugees a UN convention that says very explicitly that you shouldn't make the facts of being a refugee illegal how someone gets to the country it's not relevant to what to their claim to asylum it seems to me that there is that structural conflict going on now at the heart of government between an entire apparatus of of migration policy that expressed as you say in the nationalities and borders bill and then this new situation which I suspect a lot of people in government and in the home office will be thinking is a discrete event and yes there's a lot of moral urgency around that now but in the sort of home office mentality there will be a feeling that that all pass and it will go back to the politics of migration that we've always had and you can sort of ride this out and I got that feeling quite strongly first of all when talking to a Tory MP about this raising the nationalities borders bill and being told no no that's nothing to do with it just think how generous we were to people needing visas from Hong Kong these two things are totally unrelated the position being you can't conflate these two things you think well you kind of can when it's literally about refugees but the other thing interesting line that you get that you hear is this sense that you know you have to you can't have no checks that's why the reason one of the reasons it's taking so long apparently to process the visas is you've got to go through all the biometrics you've got to basically you know take the pictures and prove verify identities all the stuff that the EU's basically waved and said you don't have to do and that to me expresses this determination that you can't undermine the bureaucratic integrity of the migration process just because there's a war in Ukraine whereas obviously I think a lot of people in the country thinking that's exactly what you can and must do and that's the conflict it's the incompetence on show I know I mean it's hard to keep track of this that there's now meant to be a new visa application center opening in leal which is I don't know 60 or 70 miles at least from Calais and why pick there and I'll consider you notice that by the way why pick there well because it's next to the euro start presumably no it's because you think if you the argument is that if you have people too close to Calais then they become prey for that you've got both people who in there and then you know it's this idea that somehow by yeah it's by making it harder for people you're somehow making it harder for the bad guys to to smuggle them across the channel which is the exact opposite of the truth but anyway that's the but what I wanted to say was this this impression of awful incompetence the incompetence is sort of downstream from the policy right and the unease about that policy being threatened by this crisis and the incompetence then results from that so in other words they don't really want to do anything different zoe you're absolutely right there's something really there's something very chilling about this there was a load of um twitter traffic about this family this queue outside one visa office where the office was open you could see the the doors were shut and locked but the office was open you could see people inside it and it was minus three degrees outside and there were you know kids in the queue and an 84 year old and it starts to make that basically it's not an accident it's it starts to make a very powerful metaphor between a kind of overall unwillingness and an overall uselessness so that thereafter no amount of uselessness can just be cocked up it's all going to be a kind of part of the package of a government that doesn't really want to do what its international and moral obligations say that it has to and I and I think it's going to be a real problem because fundamentally Boris Johnson has got a really long way on kind of trumped up nostalgia and kind of second world war glory days and and people are watching this and it is it's a war it's a war and and they are trying to marshal these arguments about kind of solidarity during a war without the other foot falling i.e taking although our national history on this is is not exactly full of glory i was reading this morning about mrs thatcher's response to the circle of vietnamese boat people yeah let's not forget the late 70s and she and their headlines are really really similar you know thatcher opposed to influx of vietnamese refugees and all of this german jewish refugees are adults who weren't on the kindest transport yes but the adults were in terms they were basically in prison because they were german and then it's like uh but also guess what being jewish probably not going to be a fan of the nazis then they got out but i mean so oh yeah but listen none of this none of this relates to it to kind of real things this is not the first war there's been since the second world war but what it relates to is torrey and specifically brexityr myth making and that is where they're going what's the myth what's the myth that's relevant here well the myth making is that it's always been that you know we were this proud nation that stood alone that's why we wanted to leave the the eu because it's a myth of british exceptionalism and our bestie is being behind us but are kind of rediscovering that spirit rediscovering the spirit of kind of plucky britishness in you know exemplified in the second world war you can tell people that we opposed the kind of taking of jewish refugees that the only reason the kinder transport had to exist is because we wouldn't take the parents you can tell people that do your blue in the face you can tell them that the daily mail openly supported the nazis but still all their myth making is around this kind of absolute perfection of britain and its wartime record all right now let's get onto the labor party here we heard yvette cooper very effectively and passionately tearing strips off pretty patella on the record of the home office here but it's interesting isn't it to ask what labor has to offer here because it's not like kirstammer standing there saying we need to go the way of the eu it strikes me that for all its fury the labor response is is is fundamentally bound up with the efficiency of the system and the need to make it work better right so it's it's not like where people of a liberal left disposition would like labor's position to be they're not there really no it's interesting isn't it that well there seems to be a couple of elements to this one is i just residual which i do kind of understand even when i find it frustrating this idea that the labor leadership just doesn't want to be in the business of saying let's be more like the eu so the obvious thing for kirstammer to say might be look if the european union can do it you know three years uh accept out of date documents whatever it does just get people in that's the humanitarian decent thing to do he could say that he's not saying that and there's obviously political reasons why not because there is still in the back of the collective labor party mind or the leadership's mind a fear of the kind of voters who not that long ago were rejecting the labor party because they thought it had an open door policy on immigration the other thing i do think with kirstammer in particular it there's a problem not just on the policy but the expression he just if he had more if it was better giving the moral urgency he might get away with having it doesn't it doesn't do an emotion terribly well in the best possible way i mean emotion um also i mean there's a question there right about the public now i i have a theory which is that there is probably about 10 percent of the public in england which is disproportionately male actually which sort of does fit some of these stereotypes about about being sort of pull up the drawbridge and you know after these people might be terrorists and all of those horrible cliches but it's only 10 percent and it makes a lot of noise and it gets sort of confused with 40 or 50 percent of the of the public at large and and that's not the case and worse still actually it gets read into uh people's understanding of what some areas they voted heavily for brexit alike now i don't know whether i'm naive in saying that actually i think people on the whole are sort of better than that and they understand completely it's a matter of instinct the morals of a situation like this and therefore the government and perhaps the political class as a whole is sort of misreading where most people are what you find is that attitudes to immigration go up go kind of between positive and negative according to where it is in the political discourse and what it's being used for right obviously the refugee issue is very central to the agenda but it's it's through a completely different perspective so it's a perspective of kind of sanctuary and humanity rather than benefits and influxes i think it was a very toxic moment in it would have been the late 90s early noughties where the discussion of these issues focus you remember around the idea of bogus asylum seekers that new labor actually made a lot of use of that and the problem there is because i think actually most people i think you're right certainly in my experience in sort of the political mainstream there is a pretty clear distinction between refugees fleeing conflict and you know economic migrants for whatever the word who are basically looking to join the UK labor market now whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is a totally separate argument most people are capable of understanding those are two distinct categories of people and actually on a lot of continental europe you then add free movement which is a completely different eu free movement different category again and people completely understand these distinctions but in the UK we particularly contaminated those lines blurred those lines with that whole bogus asylum deliberately it was a proxy for for trying to assure people that you were aware of where they were on on economic migration from eu countries by making a huge thing about bogus asylum seekers to make it look like you were tough i mean that was that was the position of successive labor home secretaries wasn't it but arguably the worst the worst thing that tony blair did on this was to make it illegal for asylum seekers to work while their application was being processed because that that's the thing which has really made it kind of has made it crunchy at a policy level that is the thing which has left people absolutely destitute and that i think is something that is going to have to be revisited if there is even when there is a refugee crisis that comes to the UK and johnson did seem to be suggesting we were talking about many hundreds of thousands um then i think we're going to have to revisit the who can work and who can't and and that that is on labor's hands i'm afraid no and there are there are um people on the right of politics mark littlewood is his name from the institute of economic affairs i think was saying recently there are or the other day that there are labor shortages and therefore what's the problem you know that one thing answers the other um anyway we're going to pause for a moment we'll be back after this to discuss how the west decision to move away from russian oil might be playing into the hands of borish johnson's backbench MPs them again who set up the net zero scrutiny group puts another ginger group to add to the 15 there already wondering whether this is another steve baker nyseul faraj uncle tom cobley and all moments we'll be back in a bit hello guardian columnist jonathan freeland here i now have my own us politics podcast which is helpfully called politics weekly america so if you want to hear my interviews with politicians like hillary clinton or expert analysis from guardian journalists and the latest news from washington dc and beyond you should subscribe to do that just type politics weekly america into apple spotify or wherever you get your podcasts we'll be there every friday welcome back it's nice you're still there um i want now to talk about the government's net zero target for carbon emissions by 2050 and where this crisis may leave it there was a coordinated announcement on tuesday both in britain and america both countries announced a further distancing from russian energy dependence um america as always was more stringent than than we were banning russian oil gas and coal imports the british government it seems will phase out oil imports by the end of 2022 the eu where there's a a much greater level of dependence on russian gas in particular will apparently reduce its oil and gas use by a third on monday at a downing street conference with the dutch prime minister mark rutter and the canadian prime minister just in trudo boris johnson said that the british government needs to invest in more nuclear and renewable sources of energy so far the success of of the west has been in the unity that we've shown i think we're all increasingly united in the view that we've got to move away now from russian hydrocarbons we've got to do it together we've got to make sure that we have substitute and substitute supply and that's what we're we're working on as well so the upshot that seems to be well i'm only favorite of renewables but not right now right the point being that this moment sort of he says in the short term means we need stopgap supplies and if that's sort of of of hydrocarbons and that is sort of therefore encouraging elements of his own back benches that don't like net zero at all nigel farars the blessed nigel farars is back having moved from brexit to covid restrictions he's now on he wants a referendum referendum zero right i don't know i i'm i'm maybe you know naively a little bit more generous to certainly the government position on this in that i think the separates of whether or not there's kind of you know showing some ankle and pandering to the net zero scrutiny group and all that it strikes me as sort of self-evidently true that if you're having to accelerate your transition away from dependence on russian hydrocarbons very quickly and you simply can't scale up your renewables fast enough because that's quite a long process and involves a lot of investment and you haven't you know sourced out your nuclear power stations and all the rest of it you do have a problem that the geopolitics of not using russian hydrocarbons against the longer time scale of getting to fully renewable creates a gap and you might have to burn some stuff that you would otherwise wouldn't have been burning in the interim and i i think you have to be at least confront that dilemma with some honesty rather than thinking on the one hand you've got to be fully green or or or you're surrendering to steve baker well the thing is the thing is right a couple of things firstly this is how they always get us with these referendums is that we we look at them as honest brokers and then we start having kind of these complicated discussions about whether maybe they might have a point on this but maybe not such a point on that whereas actually all they're doing is trying to muster it's a muster point it's just a muster point to destroy us and i really don't think hold on to what i say so crudely put your view is that it's no coincidence that in the midst of this crisis and with all this noise from the torrey backbenches about doing away with net zero boris johnson start saying well i think we'll have to stick with hydrocarbons for quite a lot longer yeah yeah yeah there's no coincidence at all but the more important point is that you know russian gas accounts for only three percent of usage in the uk so we don't we're not left with a major shortfall we've much more much more impacted by the energy price hikes and in terms of how to meet that shortfall almost no idea works unless we were prepared to go back in time and do it five years ago so the idea that we can plug this we can plug this gap with fracking for example nothing no new approved fracking site would be on stream for at least three years from today no if we wait for two or three days more as far as i understand it a lot of the fracking wells will be full of concrete so it's absolutely pointless getting into a fight between whether we should fill this with onshore wind or fracked energy because the fracking just wouldn't be ready for it and the onshore wind we would have had to go back to 2015 and halt the moratorium which made no sense in and of itself right this whole conversation might say something i think about how right wing politics works now sort of hard right post-brexit politics in the sense that you've got the net zero scrutiny group which apparently is led by a tori mp called craig mckinley and you've got farrods outside it making all of this noise which i personally don't think one should think it's bound to fail and all that i think you know when farrods tips up he usually knows roughly what he's doing and usually he's got quite a lot of resources behind him and can sort of change the debate somewhat particularly you know he's on gb news ho ho and the problem is you've got such a weak embattled prime minister that as we know from covid restrictions right he tends to bend to what they want he tends to sing their tune i mean and i agree entirely with with zoe's analysis in terms of the sort of ratchet effect and just the extent to which it is i mean it's like it's it's not just a sequel to what happened with euro skepticism starting off with the kind of war we just don't want the euro and now we just like to repatriate some powers and before you know you're having an argument about whether you or not you should even be a member of the eu it says kind of a fast and furious level to direct past competition sequel of exactly that process with exactly you know many of the same think tanks and some of the finance behind it where it is particularly clever politically at the moment and where i think it's a real challenge for progressive left or whatever politics you want to call it the people who want us to get to net zero is the way it is being attached to the cost of living christ yeah and the political argument that says no faraj's campaign is called power versus poverty or something like that yeah so yeah they've stopped the crazy science denial stuff they no longer even though a lot of that is the same money and a lot of the same people but they've stopped saying we don't believe in climate science because they recognize that now sounds a bit wacky and the consensus has shifted so it's now saying we'd love to basically have a more renewable energy policy but unfortunately the cost burden of that is going to fall on ordinary people hard working people who like to feel they need to fill up their white vans with petrol to go to work and you're basically squeezing them so what's happening now as regards the politics of the right and net zero i think says something about why that part of politics very often captures a lot of people's political imaginations and the sort of liberal left green side of things has has difficulty doing that look at what's just happened so a matter of days ago nigel faraj announced that he was going to have a big sort of launch event for this vote power not poverty campaign at white's hotel in bolton which is built into or onto a bolt wanderer's ground anyway bolt and wanderer's then announced it didn't want anything to do with it and that event's not going to go ahead right but the point was he was having a meeting about net zero a public meeting in bolton right and those of us who were in favor of net zero and the politicians who make a lot of noise about net zero and are passionate about it i haven't seen them having big public events in bolton i just thought that very vividly said what's going wrong and the labor line on this which is tax wimful tax on big electricity companies and you know gas oil hydrocarbon stuff is much stronger than the let's have a referendum on a thing that we sort of don't agree with even though we believe in climate change you know it's much much stronger so i think they're going to get bitten on the eyes by them i think they think they've got a real with them for a hard time no it does the practicality is if it don't matter all he's got to do it's not really about whether you can have a referendum or not you've just got to go out and say all these lefties are going to make you poor again yeah i know but but listen the actual line is much simpler and much stronger for a change isn't it another one of those things that shows referendum that the sort of populist right is sort of out in the culture and in people's lives in a way that the left or the center left should be and isn't because it's sort of stuck in the orthodox sort of Westminster game i think there are two wrinkles to this one what my argument no well just first of all the extent to which you know are they actually properly out in the culture like in touch with something that's real and organic and happening on the ground that we in our metropolitan liberal kind of citadel haven't noticed or does that get kind of laundered by fleet street in the press and the conservative party i think the point is once people's bills jump really really jump up by 1500 or two grand a year then they will be right well i mean yes it depends whether the argument is then should we then have should we be having cutting vat or you know is the problem the fact that a bunch of yogurt knitting sandal wearing lefties well he wants it all he wants vat cut he wants to bring back everything i wonder whether things have moved on to sin i remember having this conversation at the time of the coalition government when David Cameron was still notionally trying to burnish his green credentials it was different era and their conservative strategists were saying it's really hard because if you raise green issues in a focus group with a group of swing voters what they will say is oh have you seen how much veg costs at the farmer's market that stuff's all middle class ripoff stuff that was what people thought of as the green issue i think it's completely changed now i think that the understanding the the the nature of what the actual issue is uh has shifted and it's also no longer just a generational thing where it's something younger people care about and they're not voters that Nigel Farage is particularly interested in so i i i'm cautiously optimistically agree with zoe that i think he's he's not going to get the same purchase and traction with this one you don't worry though zoe that he'll get purchase and traction from Boris Johnson because what happens is Farah's flexes his muscles and the Mark Harper and the Mark Harper Steve Baker net zero scrutiny group bit of the Tory party which goes all the way into the cabinet in the form of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries arguably right he's he's scared of those people we know that and so irrespective of how this lands with the public therefore you got a problem i don't even think it's about whether he's scared of them i think it's more that that's the only that's the only generative bit of support for him is mobilizing the mobilizing the people who want to say no to everything for stupid reasons you know any kind of mainstream Tory who went with Johnson because they didn't want Corbyn or whatever those people have really gone off Boris Johnson and so if he wants to generate anything anything remotely resembling kind of excitement and support around himself he does have to go to the kind of wingnut element of his party what's the cardinal rule of being a leader of the conservative party don't get on the wrong side of the daily mail and the right wing backbencher exactly that's just a rule exactly if you get on the wrong side of those things you end up out that's why I'm Theresa May it's why I'm David Cameron he's not an idiot he under Boris Johnson understands the rule before we finish and without wanting to send everyone home feeling terribly terribly depressed clearly this isn't really about the sort of machinations of the backbenchers of the Tory party and Boris Johnson's politics or lack of them and all the rest of it the point is that if we among other countries in the midst of this crisis begin to go off the idea of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 let alone an earlier date then the planet's in terrible terrible trouble is going to happen though I mean clearly what's happened now it's an argument that people are making even 10 years ago which is there's actually a brilliant geo-strategic reason to make the transition to renewables even if you don't care about the climate science has now been massively demonstrated on a huge scale like it's that's so obviously true so he said that last week or the week before actually but you did say that I did say it the week before but I felt bad about that afterwards because it sounded like I was saying oh Russia's invaded Ukraine but look on the bright side but um yeah I mean it obviously it does make that case I'm glad you also sometimes feel bad about things you say on this podcast I was I'm already feeling bad about something I said at the beginning of this podcast I thought I was sad to callus about about Yvette Cooper's motivation when actually the real issue was the moral imperative of saving refugees so I'm glad that you all sometimes flinch in hindsight you know so many people frantically sending text messages the morning after a particularly raucous party and I want to get into that on that that note I think we're gonna conclude I mean obviously this moment of even further crisis for the world is
