 This is The Guardian. Hi there, it's Jonathan Friedland, host of Politics Weekly Extra. I hope you're having a good holiday season, that you've got your feet up eating far too much, and generally having a well-earned rest. We at Politics Weekly Extra are also taking a break. Enough happened in 2021 in US politics to exhaust anyone, but we'll be back on January the 7th with analysis of all the latest in politics in Washington and beyond. I do hope you'll join us then and throughout 2022, but for now, Merry Christmas and here's to a happy and peaceful new year.
