 This is The Guardian. Hi there, Jess Getlgot here, chief political correspondent at The Guardian. I hope you're having a good holiday season and that you've got your feet up, eating lots of nice food and just generally relaxing. We're taking a small break from the podcast this week, but we'll be back on January 5th with analysis of all the latest politics in Westminster and beyond. I hope you'll join us then and throughout 2022. But for now, here's to a happy and peaceful new year.
