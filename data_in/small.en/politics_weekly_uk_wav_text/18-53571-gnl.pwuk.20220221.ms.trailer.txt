 Hello, this is John Harris, political columnist at The Guardian and the new host of Politics Weekly UK. We've got a Tory government in crisis, the opposition back in the game and the rest of us regularly exhausted and confused. Some of this is very serious, some of it verges on the absurd. Anyway, there's a lot to talk about which is why you should join me and my guests every Thursday. This is on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
