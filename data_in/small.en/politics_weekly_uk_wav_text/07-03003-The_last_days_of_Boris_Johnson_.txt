 This is The Guardian. Going, going, gone. At the time this podcast was recorded, the government had lost 38 ministers and a crowd of cabinet ministers were gathered in Downing Street to try to convince Boris Johnson to finally resign. They included Nadim Sahawi, the freshly promoted Chancellor Dix Jekka, who had been given his new job by Boris Johnson less than 24 hours before. Everything is in flux. Here's a bit of what Sazid Javid, one of the first ministers to resign, said in his post-resignation speech in the House of Commons. I have concluded that the problem starts at the top and I believe that is not going to change. As we all expected, Boris Johnson is determined to somehow, somehow cling on despite a stream of letters, some from ministers, others from backbench MPs, full of words like integrity and honesty and strongly making the case for a change of leader. When Boris Johnson appeared in front of the House of Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday afternoon, his denial of how bad things were sounded downright ludicrous. You're asking me, I love this meeting, but you're asking me again to offer commentary today from a political event when I'm here to talk about policy. Then, just as we were finishing the editing of this episode, Johnson started his second reshuffle in two days and sacked Michael Gove. So, a few obvious questions. How did we get here? What happens now? And can our political system recover? I'm John Harris and you're listening to Politics Week in the UK for The Guardian. Joining me today are The Guardian columnist Gabby Hinsliffe and her fellow Guardian columnist Raphael Bear. Hello to you both. Hello. Hello John. What a day. We're recording this at seven o'clock on Wednesday evening. Boris Johnson has just appeared in front of the House of Commons Liaison Committee, the body that gets to quiz him a few times each year. People from the news media are outside Downing Street where cabinet ministers have gathered, in the company of Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, reportedly to tell Boris Johnson that he now has to go. We're still not sure if he's going to go, when he's going to go and all that stuff, but obviously the situation is moving at speed and is quite incredible to behold. So, let's talk first of all about how we got here. We're now at the stage where the huge fallout from a scandal has long since started to obscure the scandal itself. So, let's remind ourselves of how this week's huge political drama actually started. By way of big picture, the Tories have just lost two by-elections, partygate still defines the way, a big swathe of the electorate see the government. Last week, the then Deputy Tory Chief Whip Chris Pincher resigned after allegations which he denies that he assaulted two men at the Carlton Club the previous evening, one of whom has now spoken anonymously about what happened. That triggered questions about a long chain of reports concerning Pincher's behaviour and the question of how much Boris Johnson knew before he made Pincher Deputy Chief Whip earlier this year. Now, the line on those subjects from Downing Street kept changing. What the Prime Minister seemed to be saying was blown apart by the former senior servant Samuel Macdonald, who said that the Prime Minister was briefed in person about a 2019 complaint concerning sexual abuse by Pincher which had been upheld. It's quite something to hear how what ministers were saying at Downing Street's behest changed. Climaxing in the claim that Johnson had simply forgotten that he'd been briefed about Pincher's behaviour and the fact that complaint was upheld, to follow that over sort of 36 or 48 hours was astonishing. It went something like this. I don't believe he was aware, that's what I've been told today, but that's, you were asking more about more general rumours and I've no idea what conversations have been had. I'm just, I am aware that he, the Prime Minister, was not aware of specific claims that have been made. I asked number 10 both clearly and firmly for answers on this and I have been given a categorical assurance that the Prime Minister was not aware of any specific allegation or complaint. Last week when fresh allegations arose the Prime Minister did not immediately recall the conversation in late 2019 about this incident. In order, that was Therese Coffey who I think is still the World Compensation Secretary, followed by the former Education Minister Will Quintz who's resigned and Michael Ellis. Anyway, by Tuesday the mood of Tory MPs and ministers was plummeting. A familiar story really was being repeated yet again. Ministers doing the media rounds and saying things that were simply not true and the Downing Street Press Office doing the same. Raf, let me ask you, did it feel to you at the time, and we're only talking about sort of Monday and Tuesday, as if this might tip into something terminal as it was going on? I'll be honest and say no actually. I mean certainly because for precisely the reason that you say this is quite a familiar thing that happens, the number 10 cooks up a line, they send ministers out to defend it, the line turns out to be indefensible and the ministers look kind of embarrassed but the shamelessness of the Johnson administration is so contagious that that seems to sort of have the potential to run and run without it becoming this sort of seismic landslide that would sweep the Prime Minister potentially out of his job altogether. The one thing that really did make me stop and think okay something very different is going on here is that letter you mentioned by Simon McDonald. Just because you know people who know him and I've dealt with him a little bit in private and spoken to him, it is so colossally uncharacteristic for anyone who had that role, the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, and for that man in particular who's such an expert in dealing with the kind of nuanced, euphemistic, half eyebrow raised idiom of whitehall communication to go on the record and just say look actually what's happened here is the Prime Minister has lied. That was the point at which I thought oh okay actually maybe there's just a bit too much straw on this camel's back now but other than that you felt pretty normal, sadly. I mean sort of the new Johnson normal. Gaby same for you that it was the McDonald letter which correct me if I'm wrong I think was sort of presented to Dominic Raab mid interview on the BBC which sort of heightened the sense of drama. It was yes I mean he'd put it on Twitter and then literally he came on today very shortly after Dominic Raab making Dominic Raab look like an idiot because of course Dominic Raab just defended the government line and that that definitely was the point. Monday night you were starting to get stirrings that this wasn't quite um there was a real anger there was real and I don't know whether it's because this is one where MP's personal safety felt as if it was on the line you know that that you put this guy in the whips office knowing what he is knowing what he does you put him in a position where he has an extraordinary amount of power over MP's lives really. It can make your life miserable or not if he chooses as a whip you know he's keeper of your secrets he's the person who tips you for promotion or doesn't you know to put someone who abuses power in a position where they have a lot of power and puts MPs and vulnerable people not just MPs at risk there was real anger about that and then when Simon McDonald as as Raph said you know when Simon McDonald comes out you start thinking hello this is not you know we are not in normal times. Okay so it's a combination of the of the awfulness of the Pincher case itself and Simon McDonald's intervention then tip this somewhere the party gate and so on really hadn't got to. Let's talk about the resignations because that obviously was the was the clear sign that this was going somewhere different I mean God knows in months of doing this podcast it sometimes felt like every week we've said is this it for Johnson no of course not he'll hang on that's what he does but it felt like this was going somewhere different once Javid and Sunak resigned now I think the number of resignations currently stands at in excess of 35. It struck me actually that Sunak and Javid going as dramatic as those resignations were weren't as sort of symbolically significant as some backbenchers going particularly real Johnson loyalists Redwall MPs who what felt like only a matter of weeks or days before had been his staunchest defenders. I'm talking about people like Jonathan Gullis the Stoke-on-Trent MP Lee Anderson I think his name is he's the MP for Ashfield the seat in the former East Midlands coalfield that once they started making their opinion known that Johnson should go that's when I knew it was in deep trouble. I would agree with that partly but I wouldn't underestimate the significance of just a prime minister losing the Chancellor of the Exchequer just because that created that accelerated things beyond the Conservative Party to the extent that you can't you can't have markets opening in the middle of a really difficult economic financial situation without there being a finance minister for a G7 economy do you know what I mean so it's sort of I think that suddenly zoomed the lens out a bit and said okay this is actually a major government crisis not just a psychodrama within the Conservative Party so I sort of half agree with you but I do think certainly the Chancellor going just turns it into something different automatically. My dad said that when I spoke to him about it that day so you're in full accord with my main source of wisdom. Now let's let's say Sazi Javid who on Wednesday immediately after Prime Minister's questions made his post resignation speech sometimes these are really quite dramatic political occasions we'll come on to discuss whether this one was but it sounded like this. I have concluded that the problem starts at the top and I believe that is not going to change and that means that it is for those of us in a position who have responsibility to make that change. I wish my cabinet colleagues well and I can see they have decided to remain in the cabinet and they will have their own reasons but it is it is a choice. I know just how difficult that choice is but let's be clear not doing something is an active decision. Gabby I thought I was awaiting something like I'm old enough to remember this Jeffrey Howe's big dramatic speech after he resigned from the Thatcher government and all that and that was that out of the tone a little bit of a sort of grumpy person at a corporate away day didn't quite meet my expectations of drama. I don't think it was aimed at you know I don't think it was aimed at evoking the same kind of feeling as how you know how did how didn't want to run for leader at that point for starters. I think Javid was trying to do two things there first I think he was nudging you know that bit that that extract that we've just played which is absolutely about saying look if you're still there you're condoning it you know you may think that you're sitting back and letting someone else take sort of take the risk but by staying there you are condoning it you're keeping him there. I think that was a nudge to other cabinet ministers who were teetering on the edge like Michael Gove you know come on get on with it resign and I think the other thing he was trying to do I mean he ended on a very humble note by saying I'll be very happy just to be a good husband and father and tip in occasionally from the back benches to which he thought yeah right you know he I think he was positioning himself he opened with a bit of his backstory you know I'm a kid you know he he positioned himself as someone doing the honorable thing you know all that talk about teams are only as good as their captains you know this is all stuff that Toriel didn't slap start but I think he's very much left the door open to a run there and if you're doing that you don't want to go in too hard. Now after Javid and Sunak resigned we began to see something that I felt was slightly surreal really was the appointment of replacements you know this idea of what the next cabinet was going to look like and I was very struck this this may be because I used to be a music writer but the fact that when they appointed or Johnson appointed Steve Barkley his his chief of staff to be the health secretary it was like whoa what's going on here and then there was some speculation about who'd get education and who would be the chancellor and then it turned out Michelle Donald and I have to be honest I've not I've not heard of her I don't think much up to this point and Nadim Sahari was going to be the chancellor it put me in mind of those occasions when rock groups lose key personnel like they lose the drummer in the guitar player and the songwriter and they find two guys through the back page of the music papers and then they go out as if nothing's happened and their hits dry up right like what is this and how how is this going to sustain itself and no one's really going to buy it did you have that sensation? There was a famous there was a famous gig that the who did where Keith Moon was too off his face on drugs and couldn't basically play things in Las Vegas and Roger Dortley basically said is there anyone in the audio tour room here who can play the drums and they got a couple of issues to climb up on stage and try and play with who yeah so it was a bit like and apparently wasn't a great gig. I was well I was a bit reminded of um it's quite a famous occasion when um John Squire the the guitar player and songwriter and the Stone Roses left and they'd already lost lost their drummer and with two or three new guys they headlined the Reading Festival and Ian Brown was more out of tune than ever and then that was the end of them right so like you can't do this it's not going to work I mean it's now falling apart but was that was there ever any chance do you think that patching it up in the way that Johnson did with those people in those posts he could somehow hobble on? No it's out all our stuff isn't it I mean it's not and it's not even your you know your music page now it's like getting a drummer out of the back page of the NME and 24 hours later the drummer's saying to Roger Dortley you need to leave now you know it's kind of I'm taking over the who you know it's just kind of the whole thing is is just literally how do we get through the next 20 minutes well we need a cabinet you know where can we scrape one out from don't even worry about you know junior ministerial we're just don't worry about junior ministerial appointments party chairman we haven't had one for weeks it's Oliver Dowden resigned fine let's just carry on with what we need to carry on with and then and even then you know you're slightly held to ransom by who's who's willing to serve and and who isn't I mean the odd thing about that though is that Nadim Zahawi really missed something there he's that was his option when the chancellor went you could have had a situation where the promises right you know you be chancellor and Zahawi says no I'm not doing it you know this stops here you need to go and the rest of the cabinet says we are not doing this you know we are not playing this game where we all shuffle around again you know this is it it's over and they didn't do that even at that point even when two three cabinet ministers if you count out and have gotten and it's obvious it's over they still don't have the guts to actually say so but can I ask you another question how did you feel about Zahawi then ratting on him less than 24 hours after getting the chancellor's job as you say then saying right I know I'm only the new drummer but the singer's gotta go it's ridiculous I mean if you if you believe he has to go then don't serve as his chancellor you know there is this clip there is this theory that you know a lot of people I respect advance that that Zahawi was playing a clever game because then he'll have been the chancellor you know he's he's kind of catapulted himself up the rankings a bit ahead of a leadership contest you know because he's coming at it from a more senior position I think he's shredded his reputation with a lot of people who are thinking everyone else has kind of you know maybe Zahawi's the sensible option maybe it's a centrist option if he was a real leader you know leadership is leaving the cabinet at that point leadership is not hanging around and waiting to see what happens and then joining in with there's a delegation that happens to be going um something's just come up on my computer that says that the times are saying that even pretty Patel is calling for Boris Johnson to go now there is a lot of anxiety around isn't there that he might pull some kind of Trump move of saying look I'm the one who won the eight seat majority it's my mandate you can't get rid of me now I don't know thinking about that how that could play out in the sense that the center of that kind of prospect is a snap election but then Tory candidates would have to stand on Boris Johnson's behalf and there'd be the same Tory candidates who want rid of him and so I don't I don't I'm not quite sure how that works but I've heard so much talk about it today Gabby it's been endless I mean it's an empty threat in some ways but I think it's indicative of him thrashing around looking for an answer to what happens the theory is you know that he could either lose a vote of no confidence which removes him as leader and then instead of doing what you should do at that point say I'm not leader I have a leadership contest there'll be a new prime minister um he could try and call a snap election and kind of almost like go to the country like appeal over people's heads to the country you know would you would you do you still want me as your prime minister um and it's very unlikely in those circumstances the queen would actually grant a snap election it doesn't have to um and there are a particular set of rules that Boris Johnson was quizzed about later in the day at the liaison committee and obviously had never read um which govern her decisions in the circumstances unlikely she would do it but I think the fear is partly that Boris Johnson almost does what Trump did in terms of going over the heads of process to the voters and pitches it as they won't let me stand they won't let me have a snap election Brexit is at risk you must save our Brexit now and and that doesn't necessarily you know lead him to some kind of conventional victory but it does I mean it could literally trigger violence or it triggers unrest it triggers it only takes one nutter you know and and we know there are a fair few of those around on the Brexit side Brexit has been swirling around this drama over the last few months I mean let's not forget that when the no confidence vote in Boris Johnson was held people around him Jacob Rees-Mogg is a is a good example were framing the fact that the no confidence vote was happening as a sort of remain a plot you know like it was people who wanted to somehow frustrate Brexit so that's there anyway Raph do you feel anxious about that as a prospect um uh anxious that somehow Brexit will be jeopardized by Boris Johnson leaving now they'd be fantastic that he might pull a Trump even people like you feeling worried and dismayed and scared maybe interesting Gabby mentioned that moment in the liaison committee we don't want to get bogged down right stop there stop there stop there let's play it this is what happened when Bernard Jenkin raised roughly the prospect we're talking about I wish you to be clear about one thing that if you have lost the confidence of your MPs you will not seek a dissolution you will stand aside and allow a leadership election to take place that the Prime Minister may take may send for an alternative leader that's that's the proper procedure isn't it what I'm going to do is get on with no I need to ask you which way you're quite right and where I passionately agree I need you to answer this question Prime Minister is that I absolutely know you whatever I'm going to ask you once for an election if you have lost the confidence of your MPs and you're required to step down as leader of the Conservative Party you will not seek to dissolve Parliament well I think the last thing this country needs the last thing because this has but I'm not going to step down and the last thing this country needs frankly is election so he sort of superficially rules it out without quite ruling it out I think that's my reading of that there was an extraordinary moment just before that when it first came up and he said look I would I wouldn't go to the Queen and and asked for a a dissolution unless unless and then he didn't couldn't finish the sentence and then uh Sir Bernard Jenkin kind of pressed him unless what unless what which led to that exchange that we just heard okay let me put it this way someone who's worked very closely with Boris Johnson uh said something I thought very interesting to me not that long ago about him because we think that it's all about power and he loves having power and that's why he won't give up and I think there is an element of truth in that but the clarification that was put to me was that actually what he loves is winning or in particularly what he hates is losing and so in his mind as long as he's still standing as long as he's still on the pitch he hasn't lost and he will therefore keep fighting until literally he there's no fight left in him because if you're fighting you haven't lost yet and I think that's what that represents is the sense is I can always always another move that I can make that will keep me in the game on Twitter today Raph you said this was starting to feel like I'm quoting you one of those police camera action episodes where the driver knows it ends with him in a ditch but he's committed to the chase now and the thrill of destruction is what keeps him going more than any thought of escape yeah I think that's broadly true isn't it I mean essentially you know that but that is the same point isn't it there is a sense that just being you know just having another move to make whatever it might be escalating more means that there's always the possibility that then around the corner there's something else that you can do and it's never over you've never lost and I think that's how he that's how he plays that's his modus operandi that metaphor would suggest that he's not a sort of fading indie rock group he might be OJ Simpson but um let's come on to the 1922 committee which met or some of it I think met about five o'clock on Wednesday and there was some speculation about whether there would be a rule change almost there and then which would open the way to another no confidence vote that Gabby isn't going to happen if it does happen until next week Monday I mean they've essentially given him uh I would say time for a graceful exit so just just to recap um just to go step back a second um please don't know uh and aren't sick of hearing it by now I mean you shouldn't be able to have another vote of no confidence for another year because he survived one a month ago you need a rule change to allow that to happen um you could the committee could either have decided to change the rules tonight or it could have waited until their elections to the 1922 committee next week in the circumstances you'd expect everyone elected to be an anti-borris person who is happy to change the rules so you know it happens at that point I think by saying that what they'll do is bring the elections forward have those on Monday that's likely to start the process that's saying to Boris Johnson look this is going to happen to you you're going to face a vote of no confidence you can either go through that humiliation next week or you can stand down now and that is what you know half of cabinet that's in number 10 along with uncle Tom Cobley and all is now trying to persuade him to do go in a way that doesn't damage the party I mean to a slightly certain you think good luck with that because Boris Johnson doesn't care about the party and you know he is most he is at his nastiest when he's in a corner he's charming when he's winning and when he's in a corner that's when it becomes absolutely about his survival right on that note we are going to pause and we will come back and talk about the state the country's in the state politics is in how long it can last and where it might go next hello faker others here this summer the UK will play host to the women's euro championship I would say it's going to be a seminal moment but I have promised my producers that that kind of chat is not going to be allowed on our brand new podcast the guardians women's football weekly throughout July myself Susie rack and a bunch of women's football experts will be on hand three times a week to provide instant reaction and analysis from the tournament we'll be launching with a preview episode on Monday the 4th of July so make sure to search subscribe and listen wherever you get your podcasts the guardian women's football weekly is supported by visa welcome back thanks for sticking with us in the midst of all this drama um I want to talk about what might follow this but before we we get there and we all agree that this is it I mean it might take a while but this is it yes I am I think he can't I don't think he will be prime minister um by the time of the parliamentary recess I think it's over but it depends how much damage he does on the way out I mean does he kind of burn everything down and drag the building to the raise the building to the ground behind him I think okay then the obvious question to ask is what might follow this who's not only the leader of the conservative party but for quite a while in all likelihood who's going to be the prime minister and what sort of approach they're going to take so come on who are we looking at I think the sort of manner of johnson's going has reversed the order in which I would would previously have given you the names you know up till now we'd all have been saying oh rishi sunak's a busted flush his wife's a non-dom you know he's the forgetter he's out of the running it's all fallen apart and I think that by going when they did um for both rishi sunak and uh sashijavid that's probably increased their chances because they looked like they did the honest the sort of honest decent thing and got out at the point where they were showing leadership by doing so I don't know how much sunak actually wants it I think he could quite happily go off to California and have a very nice life and spend lots of time with his children and you know make lots of money and I'm sure he would love that um but if they want it I think they've enhanced their position I would have it's obviously not going to be I think a remainder this time so sorry tom too can happen sorry Jeremy hunt the other there'll be a sort of brexit has to be safe in the hands of the next leader kind of issue so I would just very much keep an eye on penny mordant who is that candidate who doesn't have necessarily don't have anything against touch not a millionaire non-adorn non-dom not much scandal attached to her not a remainer you know lots of negatives um sort of are removed in her case and it's one of those one of those kind of leadership elections where being not being ruled out for anything else might mean that you're the one left standing at the end basically yeah yeah I mean it's happened in the past John Major was arguably an example of that right I mean Ian Duncan Smith sort of fitted the bill it's not unknown in the conservative what what raf can you give us your top three well what supporters of penny mordant would say in you know to sort of boost her chances is that she is someone who might have the potential to do something like what Boris did in terms of what Boris Johnson did in terms of holding together this very unusual coalition that that voter coalition that produced a landslide win in 2019 so the issue there as we've discussed countless times before is you want over a bunch of people who traditionally voted Labour but we're also strong leavers and wanted to get Brexit done but then you've also got the traditional Tory Shires what we now have to call the blue wall and this horrible taxonomy of walls and colours that we use in British politics now um and penny mordant being uh she sort of has the capacity to present as a sort of old school small c conservative uh and she's sort of socially liberal she's quite sort of she's not uh sort of a an egg yolk on egg yolk on tice with lied red faced old reactionary but she's also quite a brexitur and there's the sense that she could do something some of that heineken effect as it used to be described with regards to Boris Johnson reaching across to all these different kinds of voters her friends say she could do that um i think and again but the um ben wallace i just think has a great advantage in terms of just that slight job major effects of being the antidote to whatever came before now this isn't just about or the prospect of a Tory leadership contest won't just be about a clash of personalities and so on there are real policy tensions playing out here there have been for a while as far as the Johnson government's concerned which we saw on Tuesday when um Zaha'i newly promoted to the post of chancellor was sending out signals about how this was going to be a different approach than Rishi Sunak and that he was minded to cut taxes and perhaps be less head up about balanced budgets and so on there Rishi Sunak had been yeah there is a sort of middle way there though isn't there where you say okay we're not we're not suddenly going to become social democrats all of a sudden um but actually investing in infrastructure and doing these things that's now a much more mainstream position for a conservative to have uh you then inevitably get into the question of who's paying for this stuff and if you're going to be fiscally conservative on the point of debt but also want to cut taxes you just literally don't then have much headroom to start spending on the sort of things that even though the sort of will spend on infrastructure but we won't spend on benefits type um post hestletinian soft left of the that's right wing of the party if such a thing exists um would be up for but i mean more broadly i think what we've got to remember here is just the amount of pain that's coming down the track to a lot of people and a lot of people who voted conservative i mean yeah the obr forecasting you know the steepest decline in living standards since the 1950s you know inflation at 11 percent yeah everyone's going to feel this feel this pain and well i think a lot of people have underestimated uh about you know one of the all sort of forgotten almost about why boris johnson has got himself into you know such an aggressive and nasty place particularly on cultural issues is because he didn't have anything to say on the things that people actually care about and he wanted to kind of stir up his base get into sort of wedge issues on immigration or or attacking woke leftism or trying to cast the labor party as as reneging on on brexit because that was the only way he could get some kind of emotional animus behind his his his his platform because he didn't have an economic offer and i think that will be exactly the same problem for whoever replaces him and that same person will eventually discover not being able to win on the economy forces you to start fighting on culture wars and we'll be back to that zone very very quickly i think now i've been sort of thinking in my quieter moments all day about whether there is more to boris johnson's downfall than only these really really big of course questions about his character and competence and arrogance and all that and that his downfall represents political weaknesses of him in the conservative party in other ways one of which is perhaps to do with the fact their great revolutionary project although nobody's talking about it in politics it's clear to a lot of the rest of us that it's foundering that that brexit is unraveling it's not working and that's part of what's weakened his position i don't know what either of you think of that gabby i think the central problem with boris johnson isn't always has been boris johnson and it's boris johnson's lack of honesty lack of integrity inability to give a straight answer temptation to lie his way out of whatever trouble he's in and that's exactly what we've seen um with this scandal but it's also what we've seen with party gates also obviously although in paterson it's also obviously everything but i think the two are connected in the sense that brexit is also founded on a lie you know if you come in as if you're elected on a promise to deliver something that doesn't exist and can't be made to exist and then your government is going to be a process of being forced to confront the fact that actually you know your northern island deal is not what you said it was and your trade deals are not what you said we do then government is constantly forced into a position where it's you know it's it's trying to reconcile things that can't be reconciled and it's constantly you know untruthful about things and you have a cabinet of people who have shall we say a flexible relationship with reality otherwise they wouldn't be serving in that cabinet so the two things do come together in that sense the fundamental failure is not leveling with people it's not being straight with people about what the reality of the situation is what you're going to do about it what you're capable of doing about it raf there's a a famous george awwell quotation where he talks about england is a family and it's run by the wrong people in charge and and and the cupboards are full of skeletons and all the rest of it and like a sort of classically dysfunctional upper-class english family it seems to me that brexit is this thing that everybody involved knows is there and and the lies that gabbie's talked about everybody knows were told and are unraveling and therefore in this dysfunctional atmosphere inevitably pre-partygate pre this latest scandal i mean arguably sort of pre the pandemic there were sort of hints of this starting to happen this was going to be a weird government that was going to come to a weird end yeah i think that's true i mean the important distinction i would introduce here is that we tend to use and everyone in british politics tends to use the word brexit to describe two totally different things one you know is sort of real brexit which is the the practical process of extracting the uk from the institutional framework and the economic ties that were membership of the european union and the other one is a kind of psychological emotional national renaissance that is that will sort of have us uh entering a new neo-elisabethian era of of wonder you know and global britain and and restore milk and honey and the the those are two very different things and the the crucial point about the sort of the second one is as gabby says it's not available doesn't exist and the crucial thing about boris johnson's candidacy in 2019 is he became the kind of the incarnation of the denial about the fact that didn't exist and the whole kind of cakism thing that you don't have to reconcile those contradictions was sort of baked into the the very idea of making him prime minister and then one final point i'd say in relation to that is that that meant the people who he brought into the cabinet and the qualification for serving in his cabinet was willingness to be part to participate in that denial so you have someone like jacob rees-mogg who very clearly obviously looks at the world now and thinks i will never get a better job in government than the one i have now and they understand that their survival in this era is downstream of boris johnson as soon as he's gone brexit will still be there but that delusional apparatus of brexit will go that that bubble will burst when he goes i think that i mean that shows you that arguably the plot line here is like classically shakespearean it's like mccbeth or it's like scarface the gangster one with alpachino in it whereby the character commits a sort of original sin a foundational sin or a series of them and therefore their fate is sort of set at the beginning and you know that this is going to go wrong for them somehow and eventually it does and brexit and the lies that surrounded it and as you say the the denial wrapped up in it somehow is a really big part of this story we'll talk about that next week and weeks after that i'm sure i just wanted to end with a final question uh to ask a couple of political journalists and i'll sort of uh i'll account for myself here as well about how you felt really watching what's happened today and i have to say i've been completely gripped it's like a film that i don't want to end i suppose to some extent as grisly as the details of it are but also i have an anxiety about it that i don't know where it's going to end and i fear there's something unpleasant profoundly unpleasant even more unpleasant than what we've seen already waiting for this at the end of it i suppose it's a mixture of those two how do you feel gabby i mean a big news day is kind of you know glassed and brief political nerds and it's it's been like that today you know literally there've been times particularly sitting through the liaison committee you know when he's he's in the middle of a grilling for from mp's and then darren jones labor mp pops up says do you know there's a delegation of cabinet ministers literally waiting outside the door to tell you to go and you're just like am i in a cheese dream here so it's like you know actually i'm gonna wake up in a minute and realize that none of this is true so there's a surrealness of it but also actually what's worried me all the way through and i'm really glad that kierstarma opened at p.m cues this week by just going back to testimony of the victims because it's really easy to forget that in the middle of all this you know drama and excitement and it's very funny in some ways terrible you know really awful things happen to people that were brushed under the carpet and ignored and diminished and trivialized and that is what boris johnson does to people you know there's an awful human cost that's precipitated all of this and i just feel anxious that that doesn't get forgotten and raf is therefore a sort of satisfaction that he's getting his come up and found well actually not really i would have anticipated you know if you told me in advance this is what the day would look like then i might have felt that i mean at one level the very banal level i had to write something i was on the deadline so i was thinking if you're gonna go can you either go well before six o'clock or tomorrow don't go at really awkward i mean that's just a sort of journalistic kind of you know gripe but no i mean more seriously i think you know the reason i didn't feel and that as much shard and froydre as i thought i might have done under the circumstances is just thinking actually there's so much sort of slurry that has spilt across british politics that you just the more when you see him really stripped down in the roar you know in the liaison committee that that that mafiosi temperament that you see on show and you think well we don't yet know the scale of the damage that's been inflicted here and you'll be your sort of psychologically you're mentally already tossing up the bill for the repair job that's going to be have to done that's going to have to be done to british politics when he's gone and that actually kind of took some of the for want of a better word pleasure out of seeing him on the road i concur there'll be more of this next week and the week
