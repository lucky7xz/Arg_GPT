 When I look back, you know, we were after the modelling, we've been after vaccination data, you know, how much supply you've got, all of those questions which are having real life impact now and none of that information being provided, you know, it's only going to be provided for a select few and the rest of you don't have access to it and I don't think that makes a good response. It allows you to become a bit complacent and secretive and that doesn't necessarily deliver good public policy outcomes. Hello and welcome to the show. You're with Catherine Murphy, the host and I'm political editor of Guardian Australia and with me this week from her home in Canberra is Katie Gallagher who has had, it must be said, one hell of a week. Katie, welcome to the program. Thanks for having me on Catherine. Yes, it's been a big one, I've sort of lost track of where we're at, you know, what day we're at really. Exactly, what hour of the day, yes, what day, exactly. Look, if you haven't caught up with the news, I'm sure many of you have listening, Katie's daughter Evie was diagnosed with coronavirus this week which is a horrible, horrible, horrible thing to happen and rather than raising her head, I'll just ask the wellbeing question first Katie, how is Evie? She's doing okay. She's day five now, so really from when symptoms started, so I'm hoping we're through the worst of it but I think that's part of the worry for many parents is you don't really know what you're dealing with and how it will affect Evie in this case over a longer period like the first 14 days, for example. So, you know, it's been quite like any virus, a bad virus, you know, so it's knocked her out, she's very tired, she's got a lot of the symptoms, lost her appetite but she's been a trooper as well. For a 14-year-old girl, they are known to be quite dramatic and Evie is quite a dramatic 14-year-old, so I've been really proud of her because I think it has been terribly scary for her on top of being sick. Yeah, well that's managing the anxiety would be as full on from a parental perspective as managing the symptoms but a lot of people who haven't had a COVID case in their household will be just wondering basic things like how do you look after her? Yeah, so I've sort of learnt on the run, I really feel like it would be useful and I might document it to really talk through how you actually make it work because there wasn't any kind of real advice for me other than pulling together a whole range of info from different people. But it's quite a logistical exercise and it's actually quite busy in my hospital in the home so we've got Evie as much as we can quarantined in her room, my son quarantined as much as we can in his room and I'm doing most, in fact all of the entry into her room but I'm doing it in full PPE and taking a lot of care about how we deal with that and get rid of our PPE and things like that and that's really, I'm immunised so I actually do feel quite protected but my son isn't, he's a year or so ahead of Evie at school so he's sort of a bit like a sitting duck in a bit of a petri dish at the moment so hopefully we'll be able to keep him clear of it, I'm not sure we'll achieve it but we're doing our best. Yeah and it's sort of that sitting duck thing, you know, like I'm not sure, you did a bit of media earlier in the week when Evie was first known to be a positive case and I'm not sure when you did the initial batch of media that you would become every parent in Australia at that point. No I mean I think we all feel it, we all feel it, we've all, anyone with little kids, teenage kids, you know this is becoming as I think Joe Biden said originally a pandemic of the unvaccinated and our kids are not vaccinated at this point and at least in the ACT outbreak are over represented in terms of the stats around infections so I imagine a lot of parents listening to the show this week will know exactly the anxiety that you're expressing because they'll be feeling it themselves with their kids who you know that even in lockdown are literally sitting ducks in your household, you know, you've got kids literally you know sort of next to one another who yeah anyway I'm just, well I'm just you know obviously I completely understand the anxiety, I share it and I think it'll be, it's useful to have you on and talking about this because a lot of parents will share the same anxiety like so full PPE like where do you get that from? Do they deliver it to you or what happens? Well thankfully I've got really great chemists so she was able to do a delivery kind of day one, I just rang her and said I need all these things and I think the hospital and the health system is getting better about putting together support packages for people now but it wasn't there on day one which was a bit of a worry I think particularly when I'm really focused on keeping my son as much as I can hopefully negative and so yeah it's required a fair bit of coordination and I'm a former health minister here you know I know how the system works I know I know a lot so I feel like it's been easier for me than it would be perhaps for many parents I mean I was quite emotional about it which I normally aren't and so it was a mix of anger and sort of mama bear kind of reaction to what was happening and that sort of played out a bit publicly which is more than I usually give of myself but it was a very raw kind of response to what I was watching play out in my house and what I've watched in the committee at a kind of at a distant level and just looking at these kids and thinking how could we be in a position where and it's not just about my children my children aren't special you know they're the same as every other child in the country and we'd like any other family but how could we be at this point when this is the result where we've just got so many kids teenagers getting it and they're completely unprotected there and as a mother that really hit me hard looking at her particularly the first couple of nights struggling and not being able to comfort her not being able to hold her you know those kind of things that are just so natural to us as parents that had to be turned on its head and I just felt this kind of really angry response to things that I felt probably could have been avoided or you know and I'm not saying that no teen would ever get COVID-19 but that there would be a level of protection that we could offer them that doesn't exist at the moment. Mmm and it's basically a supply problem I'm sure that if we had if we had the available supply I mean this is the Doherty Institute has already sort of begun that pivot in the strategy by saying look we've got to look at peak transmitters and peak transmitters are young people teenagers and young adults we've got to vaccinate them as soon as possible but anybody I know who's tried to get a vaccination for their teenager you know is having all kinds of trouble I mean I think it's a bit different in New South Wales because they've brought forward vaccinations for young people but certainly in Canberra it's AstraZeneca or bust at the moment and then it's not like you've got a walk up start with AstraZeneca appointments either you've got to you've got to wage and then it takes a period of time for vaccines to be clinically effective which all feeds on the anxiety loop that you've heard. Exactly. We're basically sharing here we're just yes anyway it's um it's really hard yards so how have you found the sort of backup and support from local health authorities like you know what do they do do they do they ring and see if everyone's okay like how does that all play out? Yeah so uh look it's pretty good um I think there's areas where it could be improved but that's me looking at it with a you know former health minister's lens over it so I'm probably kind of looking at it in a different way as well but from practical sense so the negative people in your house get a text message each morning you say whether you've got symptoms or not I don't know where it goes off to but it goes off somewhere and then for Evie usually a phone call in the afternoon just to check in on her but what I found more useful and again I feel very privileged and lucky is our GP is actually calling in on telehealth twice a day to do a consult directly with Evie and I have to say that has been amazing and has really helped with Evie's anxiety who of course being a 14 year old girl and all the you know information they pick up largely on TikTok um isn't the best place to get your information so being able to talk to her doctor who she trusts and have her doctor tell her you know that she's not going to die tonight which is one of one of her big fears and then her other big fear was giving it to us and then having Dave and I die and you know it's always at the extreme end of the debate there's no in between and that has been an absolute lifesaver which you know if you could have that for every person who's covered positive um maybe it's unrealistic but that has been absolute godsend then we have to get tested at some point um hopefully that will be done in reach where they come to us because you know I could actually be positive now I don't know um yeah and so we'll go through that but it looks like a long stay in isolation for for me actually and the others because we have to be clear 14 days after Evie clears the virus so it could be up to 28 days or longer that we are um required to isolate at home which of course is fine and your son how's he dealing with the anxiety I sort of feel obtrusive in a way because I you know my kids know well my kids are a little bit older than yours but similar age and and I don't want to I don't want to actually intrude on their privacy in this conversation that's not fair or reasonable but obviously he'd be worried about his sister he'll be worried about getting it himself so how's how's he traveling is he all right yeah and I think that my kids are a bit used to having a noisy mother that talks to everybody about them all the time but he's um he's the opposite of his sister in a way she's more highly strung he's very laid back a bit older than her so you know cruising with his headphones on happy that he's been given unlimited you know free gold pass to uh life on his computer playing games uh feeding carbs sort of every two hours um and he's communicating with his sister on snapchat which seems you know not entirely unusual for the way they conduct their sibling correspondence so I feel lucky I feel I actually I'm a bit emotional all over the shop about it but I do feel really well supported in a place like Canberra lots of neighbors dropping things over people offering to help you know pulling together all the kind of care side of things but I can imagine that a lot of people might not be in my position and how you know it is is still isolating and scary particularly at you know two o'clock at night when you're doing your ward rounds um and just hoping things are going okay so yeah it's uh been a week but yeah been a week that's where we started and that's where we've landed so yeah god sorry sorry it's just it's really visceral I mean talking about your kids yeah thinking about you know anyway we don't need to explain that to one another or to anyone listening to us I don't think anyway um but I wanted to I actually invited you on before I realized obviously that you were going to have the COVID week from hell um because I wanted to talk to you about your committee work and also some portfolio issues so we'll we'll get to that now and now I think I was so keen to bust in and find out how easy it was I didn't even properly introduce you at the top of the show anyway Katie. Katie loves that she does there is a side of her that's loving being this stuff she was pretty impressed with her media coverage earlier in the week oh good and please because of course I haven't even bothered to introduce her mother properly anyway let's do that now Katie is the shadow finance minister and in terms of the committee work that I flagged a second ago what I'm talking about is uh Katie has led the the senate select inquiry into the government's management of coronavirus and that committee process has basically tracked the trajectory of the virus in real time you've been calling officials before that committee to account at all stages really of the pandemic for what's been going on so why don't you just tell the listeners what that experience has been like let's just sort of paint a broad picture first and there's there's a couple of specific questions I want to ask you about it yeah sure so the um covid committee it was negotiated with the government's support right at the beginning of the pandemic when back in when was it 2020 march april yeah late march early april 2020 when we weren't sure how the pandemic was going to roll out and whether the parliament would sit and there was an acknowledgement that there should be some level of accountability built in to the response particularly if the parliament couldn't sit and at that point we didn't think it would sit for for a long period of time and so the select committee was set up with the government's support to basically be the you know I guess the structural kind of engine of of that accountability mechanism and so we've had I don't know probably more than 50 hearings now so we have tried as you said in introduction to monitor the government's response as much as we can in real time acknowledging that when there's been really big you know outbreaks and things like that we've had to allow officials to focus on that and have the hearings later but we've tried to track the whole response from the health and the economic point of view i would say we've had more of a focus on the health one probably in the last 12 months because we've been following the kind of vaccination and quarantine side of things and a lot of the economic supports had died down by that point in time and where issues have arisen whether it be childcare or aged care or transport workers aviation infrastructure we've been able to try and follow those areas as well because you know there's been so much public money just rolling out the door more than has ever happened in the past and we haven't really had the usual scrutiny processes and they've all you know usually it's all been in a rush and money's got to get out and things have to be put in place and so we've been trying to as much as we can document that really from a historical point of view but also real time as well and and track it so it's been a privilege really to be in that position where i've been able to chair it and work with my colleagues right across the senate well and that's uh that was exactly the first question i was going to ask you um because it's been quite interesting to me that the sort of disposition on that committee has been quite collaborative and also the reports that you've produced have been largely multi-partisan i mean this there's been different comments here or there but uh for example one of your reports was highly critical of the government for you know basically holding back documents that the committee had sought relating to some of the management of the pandemic and you know the government senators didn't dissent from that i mean they had their own comments is my memory but they they didn't dissent from it so it's it's quite interesting like how have you built that sense of well camaraderie might be a stretch but but that sense of common purpose about the accountability exercise is that something the committee's had to work on actively or is it just everybody understands how significant the moment is and we've all got a role to play and best we play it i'm just interested how that's all played out behind the scenes yeah i think it's a bit of both katherine i think it's a bit of um my kind of style as the chair and i've tried to build in collegiality and fairness across the way we conduct the hearings i like the hearings to be quite respectful um you know and i think people have kind of acknowledged that i'm not you know i'm not trying to not allow government senators time to ask questions because all of most of this has been done remotely as well remember so it's been an unusual which maybe helps in that regard because possibly you know we're not all in the room like in estimates perhaps it's a more kind of can be a more you know testy environment but i've usually been the only senator in the room and everyone else is on video and so it does kind of provide a bit more distance maybe that's made us all more well behaved um but also very decent senators you know i like all of them um the deputy chair james patterson great to work with perin davey great to work with rachel seawood great to work with and my colleagues mary and christina um so i i think that's part of it the the people who are on the committee the approach i've got as chair and then i think you're right the the moment we're in the seriousness of of it all and the role that the senate's given each of us to play in providing that accountability scrutiny and also reporting back to it when we think things need to be said like we've done we've done two reports we'll have more um one of them was really trying to capture the first year of the pandemic everything that went on and the second report was about well speaking on behalf of the committee the frustration with uh some of the you know attempts to not provide the committee with what we think are reasonable requests for information and do you think the disposition of um the witnesses has changed over time like i mean i've watched not every single one of those hearings but i've watched a number of them uh because like you are sort of interested in documenting the history like the first draft of history about these extraordinary events that we're living in right so and i found the committee process to be very helpful in putting some of those stories together but it sort of strikes me just observing at the start i think uh people were so well a combination of energized freaked out but you know sort of attentive and and on the job i thought myself that um witnesses were a bit more forthcoming at the start than they have been as the pandemic's gone on and i mean i guess there'd be a basic psychology behind that right like as you as an event unfolds you have a record which then you have to defend a bunch of decisions that you make and you know perhaps at the start there was no record to defend right so everybody had a degree of well it just struck me that people were a bit more open than they normally would be at estimates and other places am i imagining that or is is that sort of broadly fair no absolutely i think that's right those first hearings um really i think from both when we had hills and treasury coming you could tell that this was happening in real time almost um decisions were happening so quickly if an issue was identified you you could see from officials that they knew about it were on to it might not have all the answers but you know wanted to be able to or maybe they used the committee as more of a vehicle for reassurance that you know they were across things they were going to be responding um you know they could explain why they'd taken the decisions like in treasury's case about why job keeper was structured the way it was you know you could um why the advice to government you know about those three initial economic support packages rolled out the way it did you could see um certainly genuine engagement i think it's become more defensive uh in in the second year of it and i think that's right there's a bit of history there's a bit of lead in the saddlebags um and people start using the more traditional ways of kind of protecting evidence which is you know take it on notice um don't answer bat it away and refer it to the minister for a public interest immunity claim so i think we've been seeing more of that as there's been more criticism about the commonwealth government's response and i would say that's really focused largely in the health area yes what's been you know if you could just sort of identify this is a bit of an unfair question but like what's your biggest insight as a consequence of this work like what what would you how would you distill your observation about what you've learned through that evidence through that incremental rolling evidence right obviously we're all in a political conversation so i'm aware of obviously what labor's attack lines are against the government and i'm not suggesting that's that's a pantomime i mean the attack lines actually reflect the reality but you know has there has there been some thunderbolt or some big insight that you've come across as a consequence of this work bit of a silly question but i'm interested in what what the answer might be i think for me um i i come from a point of view where i sort of have some understanding of what being in government's like it's a it's a bit of a memory for me but so i understand that our systems aren't always perfect and people don't expect them to be perfect but i also come from a point of view where sharing and providing information is often the best way of ensuring good bureaucratic responses you know that it's when you shut down and don't provide information which is into public interest for whatever reason and the usual argument is commercial incompetence or that old favorite of national cabinet in confidence which we've never accepted is a way of not actually facing up to some of the problems and having that defensive approach rather than an open approach where you know you are sharing information people have access to it knowledge and then you're improving as you go and i think when i look back you know we were after the modeling in the early days what did the health modeling say we've been after vaccination data we've been after you know how much supply you've got all of those questions which are having real life impact now and um you know none of that information being provided you know it's only going to be provided for a select few and the rest of you don't have access to it and i don't think that makes a good response i think it doesn't hold you know if you feed to the fire it allows you to become a bit complacent and secretive and that doesn't necessarily deliver good public policy outcomes um let's just do the portfolio now uh covering a hell of a lot of ground here but let's just um let's sit down there for a tick so a big decision uh in the economic portfolio as yours and jim charmer's in labor in recent times has been the decision by labor to end your opposition to the stage three tax cuts that decision was announced a few weeks ago now katie what would you say to people like me who think this is bad policy well i'd say it's one that we've consulted on heavily um we've we've taken our time we always said when it passed the senate that we would go through a process around that and consult discuss and then make our own decision you know it passed the senate it's legislated um it's written into the forwards and you know we've taken the decision to to not well what's the the language for it not to to not go the election to repeal it with a with a position of repealing it and um i think you know that reflects the shadow cabinet's discussion it reflects our deliberations more broadly with stakeholders but it also means you know we want to focus on other areas in the election campaign you know we want to we want to be focusing on matters that we want to be talking about and just picking up that last point was the concern that um certainly the experience in 2019 was that a number of issues were weaponized against labor during that campaign climate change being an obvious one and and there was also tax tax was um franking credits was sort of presented to a lot of voters as a death tax for example was it was it a political decision or a or a policy decision i mean it's hard to separate the two isn't it i mean there's certainly um you know policy and politics in there um we want to win the next election we want to be very focused on that we want to go to the Australian people with a clear agenda about what that looks like and what a Labor government will do and i think you know from my point of view from where i sit we're setting out the framework for that to happen we've made a decision around tax and now we work with the budget and the priorities that we have and we go forward with that agenda look and it's not easy you know these decisions are never easy i you know and they're never made you know over one conversation it's a lot of thought goes into them and partly the fact that they've passed the Senate was you know a key consideration there they are legislated tax cuts we want to focus on on other areas in the recovery from COVID-19. What do you think uh again and this is sort of most pertinent for a finance minister or a shadow finance minister because you know a lot of your task is sort of being Dr No with the colleagues right people come with sort of vast amounts of expenditure with great ideas and finance traditionally is Dr No finance is where are your offsets or you know how are we going to basically reconcile this expenditure with the budget bottom line is that argument which has sort of been a real straitjacket for Labor for several campaigns right um is that over is that sort of like my budget bottom line is better than your budget bottom line is that gone do you think or is that still a consideration that Labor has to take into account in developing your election platform? I don't think the next election is going to be fought in that old or older language from the Abbott years forward about death and deficit disaster because I can't see how that can happen I mean this government has got you know its budget papers have deficits for 40 years debt for at least that long um trillion dollars in debt so you know I don't know how anyone can go into a campaign when we've got the set of numbers like we've got and say you know my budget is better than your budget but I still feel that the Australian people expect responsible budgeting um you know it's it's their money it's public money that's raised to allocate across a whole range of areas and they want to be assured that you know the decisions taken are mindful of the importance and value of every public dollar and so I think there's still very much a discussion that has to be had about responsible budgeting within the numbers that we have but I hope that some of that kind of crazy all debt is evil and all deficits are bad you know might be a bit quieter in the election shouting that goes on because I honestly can't see how the government can get away with running that kind of campaign again. But but nonetheless though and this is why I started with the stage three tax cuts although the options that you were looking at prior to the decision wouldn't have raised masses of revenue which is sort of one of the reasons why the discussion landed where it did but obviously if you if you support the stage three tax cuts that does constrain your own expenditures. Do you accept that or do you or do you think not so much in an environment where debt and deficit disaster isn't as front and centre as it might be in an ordinary election season? Well I think we know the numbers at well unless if we go we've got the latest budget numbers and we'll get my EFO at the end of this year so we have a pretty good indication of what the budget forwards look like and that brings in in a year of those tax cuts stage three coming in. So we've got that as part of our thinking and you know I guess I'll just repeat what I said before we know that we have to be responsible about the allocation of funds within that so you're not going to see us just chucking money left right and centre and saying it doesn't matter anymore it does matter we want to be careful we want to be thoughtful about and we want to have our priorities and we want to make sure that every dollar spent actually delivers a particular outcome we don't want to just be you know you what that's what you'll see from Jim and I you won't see you know just throwing money around and hoping that people like it we want to be able to have policies like our child care policy like our you know rewiring the nation policy things where we can actually demonstrate that we are using the budget for this purpose and at the end of the day this is the outcome we expect to see whether it be you're getting better support to access child care or we're making the energy grid stronger and more resilient about delivering energy to households. So I think everything has to have an outcome for us that's the discussion Jim and I've had we acknowledge we will need to spend money but we really want to make sure that where we are spending it it's actually going into the things that we need to invest in in the recovery out of the pandemic and you know our policies are going to be very much guided by that. And what about offsets like we'll we'll major spending I mean a lot of the spending that the government's oh sorry that labor that labor is foreshadowed thus far I mean child care's not but like rewiring the nation a lot of those things are off budget those those dollars now we're yet to see from you guys you know a health spend a higher ed spend a school spend an NDIS spend like there's there's quite big calls on the budget in all of those areas right are you proposing offsets or again like I mean the government's not offsetting expenditure at this point in time right they've rewritten their fiscal rules what are labor's fiscal rules at the moment? I guess I've kind of outlined some of them in terms of of saying you know every dollar spent has to deliver an outcome it has to be careful it has to be targeted we will have more to say around offsets or savings or you know reductions in programs where in the lead up to the election where we think that's sensible that's some of the work that I'm looking at now you know I'm going through the budget and if we were lucky enough to form government I think there's more work that you do on the other side of that you know once you're incoming to make sure that you are tightening up the spending that's happening across the budget I mean one of the areas I am critical of the government is that they have thrown their fiscal rules out but some of the you know we call it waste or rots in the budget are expensive you know and and some of those areas need tightening up and we would be looking at those areas too some of the ways they're treating the public service at the moment you know the labor higher costs which are extraordinary and I think fundamentally that comes from the fact that I don't know that the liberals see the public service in the way that I see it as a you know public good and needing to be resourced and built in terms of capacity and capability when you're just outsourcing large chunks of it but often at more expense so there's all of those areas too where I think we would want to be tightening things up but there's a lot of work to be done in that area I just don't accept in a budget of you know 500 billion dollars that there isn't savings sensible savings to be made and what about taxes we'll end here this is sort of this is where the language becomes a bit sort of tortured right you're not going to repeal income tax cuts that have been legislated right what about new tax measures though like is the lesson from 2019 you can't have revenue measures at all because they might be weaponized against you or is there some sort of a midpoint between nothing and something that we haven't seen yet well there's certainly um you know work this is more in Jim's area where he said publicly around multinational tax reform where he would be looking for opportunities there so I don't think it's a nothing or everything but I think it's particularly looking in in targeted areas and the one we would be looking at mostly would be in that area in multinationals yeah all right that's so it sounds between nothing it sort of says between nothing and something there's something yeah there is yeah I think from my point of view yeah my point of view and my my portfolio it's looking at the budget looking at making sure we're tightening up some of the spending going on there where it's sensible to do so so that we can reallocate to other priorities which you've listed them there's plenty of them that need to be resourced and I guess I come from a view that a budget is there to serve a particular purpose to deliver outcomes to the community and we need to make sure that those decisions are right and they're doing what the community asks us to do as as leaders and allocate those funds fairly and and responsibly let's end there thank you so much for your time I appreciate it we'd better let you get back to the patient hope she's okay um thank you to Alice I've had one ear on here oh yeah so I was going to say she right sort of yeah I've got this kind of I've got my own mother background track on this entire conversation anyway sorry um thank you to Alice and Shan who's producing uh this episode for us thanks to Miles Martagnone who's the EP of the show Parliament's back but not with you Katie or the or are you are you going to be virtual or no oh I might be I just see how the little one goes um but yeah there's an able team in Canberra ready and willing to you know to get going step up step up next week Christina Cadilis about to burst out of quarantine isn't she I think so and a few others too but yeah a few others yes anyway Parliament's sitting next week we'll be back then thanks for listening
