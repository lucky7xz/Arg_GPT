 The leading media group in Australia has been a promoter of climate change denialism for a long time. But Murdoch said just yesterday there were no deniers then. No deniers. That means he's obviously not reading his own newspapers. Hello good people of pods and welcome to another episode of Australian Politics Live. It's Catherine Murphy with you and I'm in Sydney today with my boss and my very good friend, Lenore Taylor and our special guest in the studio in Sydney for this week is Malcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader. With bushfires such a profound issue that's captured the national consciousness, with renewed debate in the public domain about climate change policy and the best means of trying to mitigate damage, we thought it'd be a good week to bring Malcolm Turnbull in for a conversation about climate. It's an issue he's very passionate about and it's an issue we're passionate about as listeners know so that conversation is coming up. So we're seeing the reality of climate change right now in Australia in the most terrible ways. What is the appropriate political response to that? How should we be reacting to that rhetorically and in policy sense? Well honestly is the most important thing. The reality is that the consequence of climate change, as we have known for many years in Australia, is hotter and drier times and rainfall, less rainfall generally, but more erratic rainfall. So if you have a hotter and drier climate, that means that you will have more bushfires and more and longer droughts and we're seeing both. I mean this is exactly as was predicted and expected, so there are no surprises here or there shouldn't be. What about though we've seen, particularly as the bushfires have escalated over the last couple of weeks, we've seen a debate in the public domain that oh well Australia only contributes 1.3% of global emissions, nothing Australia can do would make any difference to any of this stuff. I've seen this everywhere over the last couple of weeks. These are the worst arguments really. I mean on that basis you could say if I don't pay my tax it's not going to result in the army going without pay because I'm only 0.00% of tax receipts. I mean the reality is Australia has to take action to reduce emissions, we have a commitment under the Paris Agreement to do so and I think also people look to Australia as a developed country, a wealthy country to take a leading role. When we respond to bushfires we obviously must respond swiftly, compassionately, practically, helping people, helping those people who have lost lives, been injured, lost property. Compassion and empathy is vitally important. But we also have to recognize that this is a symptom of the reality of a hotter and drier climate and almost every morning you hear on the radio a farmer and I've spoken to so many of them directly who has in his or her records, rainfall records going back over a century and they will invariably say we have never seen anything like this before. So people on the land, I had this experience when I was prime minister and I see it today, I'd see politicians who claim to represent the bush talking about climate change and I tell you they are not speaking for farmers and most of them don't know the first thing about farming and they don't know the first thing about agriculture and the reality is people on the land are living with and dealing with the consequences of a hotter and drier climate. So do you think the way we respond to this actually impedes our ability to argue internationally for tougher action? Well of course it does, I mean you have to be seen to be taking action, if you're not taking action you're not going to have much credibility. Our climate diplomats if you like, environmental ambassadors and so forth have done a very good job over the years and very very proficient and you know technically skilled in every respect but it's very important that Australia is seen as taking action and taking the issue seriously. Now how much you do and when you do it and the manner in which you do it, these are all important issues but I think you know the tragedy of our times in politics on this issue is that what should be a factual scientific issue, a matter of physics if you like or as I used to say engineering and economics, a factual matter has become an issue of identity and I mean Greta Thunberg nailed it when she said I come to America and in America they've got the same phenomenon and people talk about believing climate change. Well she said in Europe it's regarded as a question of fact and so it should be, it's like saying do you believe in gravity. Tell me because you're better placed than anybody to actually tell me this story. John Howard in 2007 lined the Liberal Party up behind an emissions trading scheme. Obviously Howard went on a bit of a journey, shall we say politely, to land in that position but there was the Liberal Party primed and ready to go. Then after 2007 something went wrong. What went wrong? Climate denialism started to take root initially in the United States and what should have been again been a practical issue of you know there's that great quote of Howard's about how important it is as a prudent conservative to take insurance and that's common sense but the issue became one of identity rather than one of fact. Why though Malcolm, why did that happen? Well there are many theories about it. I think the people with big economic vested interests had a hand in it but quite why so many people became persuaded that climate change was fake. I struggle to understand. I mean there are people who believe the earth is flat. There are people who believe that Elvis is still alive. You know that the moon landings were faked. There are plenty of odd beliefs out there and conspiracy theories but what I have always struggled to understand is why climate denialism still has the currency that it has and particularly given that the evidence of the impact of climate change is now so apparent and it is particularly apparent to people living in regional and rural Australia where precisely what was forecast is happening and we are you know we have seen a step down in rainfall availability and that has all of the implications for fires and droughts that we're witnessing and experiencing at the moment. But specifically in Australia why do you think those arguments have had this way that they have had? Well I think they've been they have been amplified in the Murdoch press. You can't get away from that. The leading media group in Australia has been a promoter of climate change denialism for a long time. But Murdoch said just yesterday there were no deniers then. Yeah well I would that means he's obviously not reading his own newspapers but or watching his own cable news channels. No I don't think you can take that too seriously. The fact is that they have given it a lot of amplification. Having said that it is a very significant question you know why is something that that that common sense says should be a question of fact. I mean I gave a speech years ago but you know when we're still in opposition about this and I said that you know people that reject the experts on climate change are like somebody who was told by their physician that they should you know lose weight stop smoking eat better healthier diet and says no I won't do that because I was talking to a guy down at the pub and his uncle Ernie you know smoked you know a carton of cigarettes a day and drank a you know a dozen schooners and ate meat pies and lived to 90 and I mean that like you say that it's laughable but that's essentially where we have got to in so many cases I mean I had one occasion where a very prominent business person was telling me that you know the whole climate change thing was a fallacy and I I asked him why he said that and he he showed me some stuff he'd read on the internet which was actually published by the LaRouche uh who was this person name names go on we'll we'll we'll be discreet for for the moment but interestingly this was a gentleman whose business relied on dealing with engineers and experts in many scientific disciplines and he was a bit embarrassed when I pointed it out to him but it it it shows you that you know people are very prepared to believe what they want to believe and so if they only need a you know a shred of justification for believing that there isn't a problem they'll grab it but we have to recognize that that we face a very very serious challenge it's getting worse by the year you know time is is not our friend but the good news is I mean just to you know get onto the good news for a minute the good news is that we can see a way through it we are now in a position where we can deliver and this is what I was endeavoring to do as PM we can deliver an electricity generation system which is zero or very near zero emissions we can have clean energy and very cheap energy technology is that going to be is our friend there this is the speech I gave in Paris in 2015 I said technology will provide the answer and it is. Is it partly because we've allowed the debate to be framed in terms of costs the whole time when in fact the cost of technology has come down so much that we should be framing it now in terms of benefit I've just finished reading Roscano's book about how it could be a renewable energy superpower like if the debate was framed in terms of opportunity do you think that would help? I think that would I think that's really how you've got to see it I mean you've got to recognize that when we were talking about this in 2007 when I was environment minister and Howard's government you know solar and wind were much more expensive than generating electricity from burning coal that is literally no longer the case there is no way you would with with any in any rational economic way build a new coal-fired power station in Australia now aren't politicians talking about subsidizing it? Well that that would be a major mistake I mean that the reality is the only argument the bet that there there is one argument and I've you know I've talked about this in the past there is one argument to justify a new coal-fired power station which would be as a demonstration plant of the most you know the most clean coal operation that you could imagine preferably with carbon capture and storage but I have to say to you things have moved on you know it that that is no longer it is no longer an economically viable alternative the game has been won you know the better mousetrap has arrived has won the the battle and the and what the best combination is now variable renewable energy which is for the most part will be for the most part in Australia solar I think in due course but solar and wind plus storage and that can be pumped hydro it could be batteries it could in due course become hydrogen or it might be a gas peaker which obviously has emissions but the bottom line is that the renewables have won and that is why nobody in the energy sector is wanting to build new coal-fired power stations this is not to say that we don't need to eke out a few more years you know I mean I was very concerned about ladle closing peremptorily in 2022 and I tried to persuade them to keep it going for a few more years not because I liked old coal-fired power stations but because I knew snowy 2.0 was going to come on stream in 25 and I was concerned that we could have a shortage of dispatchable power in New South Wales between 22 and 25 now I think that's you know other solutions have been found for that but that's why I say it's got to be planned so you don't you want to be making sure that as the old coal-fired power stations close down you've got the new energy dispatchable energy coming up but governments could really stuff up that to use the technical term stuff up that cost curve if there's intervention to shore up the more expensive old technology that's the one thing that could really show up subsidizing coal is about as crazy as you could get the argument in favor of subsidizing renewables was twofold one was that it helped reduce remissions that was the weakest argument the better argument was that by subsidizing it you created the demand which resulted in you know an improvement in the technology the benefits of scale all of that which is the whole rationale for the red which will reduce lower cost for renewables and there's no doubt that's happened I mean that that is in some respects all those subsidies in Germany over the years provided enormous impetus as they have in other countries including our own but to be subsidizing a technology that is you know frankly more expensive is not is not a great idea it's a really bad idea I mean my concern is that we want to have lower emissions and lower prices now that those two used to be seen 10 years ago you would have said that is that they're incompatible they are not now they go together so the the risk and this is my argument about the neg the risk of abandoning the emissions reduction you know agreement or measure is that you end up with both higher emissions and higher prices and that is a lose-lose you've sort of semi-answers the question because I'm glad you raised the neg because as we're speaking today in Sydney on Friday ministers energy ministers are meeting in Perth and there was a run as I'm sure you know by a number of the state governments to try and revive the neg however Angus Taylor has basically said we're not doing that and so now a number of bilateral agreements are being negotiated in lieu of the policy mechanism now a couple of things about the neg I read in Nicky Saver's book that you wanted to pursue well you wanted to go ahead with a national energy guarantee you had the legislation ready it went to the tables office and Christopher Pine and Peter Dutton withdrew it from the tables office is that true can that possibly have happened well I mean Christopher was the manager of government business that may well be right but it was at the cabinet were absolutely of the view and I agreed with them that at that time we couldn't afford to put the legislation in if it was going to be lost you know we had a growing group on the back bench that were telling us they were going they would cross the floor and vote against it which means that we would lose a you know important vote on the floor of the house the national party were moving as well so there was a an insurgency going on now whether it was really about the neg or really about destabilizing my leadership is the subject of a few books as we know but it was that you know the view it wasn't a decision of mine alone I was keeping the cabinet very very close and we were making decisions collectively but we did not abandon it I mean again you know people have said Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the neg that is not true what we said was we won't put the legislation in until we're confident it can be passed it was and it remained government policy it ceased to be government policy under Scott Morrison he he or his government yes made a decision formally to abandon no no that's absolutely right he took the cabinet decision to abandon the policy that's for sure you are in fact Scott Scott was very much of the view at the time that we should not abandon the neg that we should stick with it but that we shouldn't put the legislation in because we're worried that we're setting ourselves up you know to get rolled by people on our own back bench whose interests that's to say the least they did not have my best interest or frankly the government's best interest at heart is it slightly more complicated than that in the sense that I mean it's it's arguable whether labor would have passed that legislation but my my own judgment is that they would have and so it wouldn't have been you wouldn't have lost you would you wouldn't have needed I mean you would have split the government yeah you would have you would have needed to I mean if we had got through that week that is a discussion we could have had with labor potentially but you wouldn't want to put yourself in the you know at the mercy of Bill Shorten at the time he he did not have my best interest at heart either so you know this was the challenge I always had labor the kind of the official opposition and this group within the coalition that would rather we lost an election than won it under me but 12 months on but do you have any regrets about that now now I mean it's like if we go back to the mad week right we go back to the mad week I asked you on that on that day in that press conference whether or not you were in essence giving Tony Abbott what he wanted by by icing the schedule what do you have it's just a simple question yeah do you have any regrets about what you did in that week now could you have seen a set of circumstances where you just said we're going to do it and be damned I think in the circumstances I couldn't have done that I mean I'm I ran a cabinet government how could I have said to the cabinet who were as far as I'm aware unanimously of the view that we should not put the legislation in unless we could be satisfied that we would carry it we always expected we might get you know one or two crossing the floor but the numbers were getting up well into double figures so the temptation for Shorten to use that as a means to bring down the government would were very very strong so the the cabinet's view which I shared and it was that you know we should hit the pause button on that while we get through the rest of the week now look people have always been urging me to you know take rash actions but I think that was I think at the time the right thing to do was to stay to stick very close with the cabinet but but you know there are a different you could make different arguments look the people who decided at the last minute to indicate they would cross the floor against the neg did so knowing that they were doing enormous damage to the government and they did it in order to do enormous damage to the government because the neg was not a policy that you know was not a captain's call it had gone to the cabinet numerous times it never been any opposition to it in the cabinet had gone into the party room numerous times it had the support of industry it had there's never been an energy policy that's had as broad support as that I think you'd agree with that and that of course is why the state governments including the state liberal governments wanted to stick with it but again it's become part of this crazy identity politics and so for no good policy reason it's not being continued with I mean Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg were two of its keenest supporters so Scott hasn't suddenly decided it's a bad idea any more than Josh has what they've recognized is that there is a group within the party that are prepared to blow the show up use this as a means of blowing the show up if they persist with you in in this conversation about the neg and what happened in those weeks you've indicated that you know various people didn't have the best interests of the government at heart right various sure did Scott Morrison have the best interests of the government at home well I I yes I think he Scott was uh absolutely I mean I don't want to get into the all the ins and outs of the various ballots but I mean Scott Scott was um um I mean the neg was something that was a a joint project and Scott had a hand in it as obviously Josh was the energy minister I suppose had the largest hand in it but so did I and the rest of the cabinet particularly the energy subcommittee of cabinet so I don't think the there was anyone in the cabinet that was against the neg I mean even Peter Dutton who of course you know was the leader supposedly of the insurgency he had never criticized him to my knowledge to my to my recollection I mean he just never might there'd never been a criticism about it I mean uh Angus Taylor had always been you know an internal critic of the neg but uh would never entirely clear why so we've lost the policy mechanism now but we still have the target that you signed up for in Paris yeah yeah do you think that we have policies right now to reach that target and also that target's debated now as if it's the bit the end of the story but as I recall Paris there were always going to be reviews like the expectation was that ultimately we'd have to do more than that so do we have the policies to get to 26 to 28 percent and do we have the policies to get further if that's what we eventually have to do well I think in the absence of a rapid decarbonization of the energy sector I think we will struggle to get to the 26 to 28 percent target that's why the neg was very important it was going to contribute to that obviously the use of carryover credits can assist but you know that's that's a controversial one but you're right I mean the 26 to 28 percent pledge we made in in Paris was just the first step I mean we must not kid ourselves and I'm on the record saying this you know many places that to arrest or slow global warming to acceptable levels we have to get to a complete or near complete decarbonization of the energy sector and so the generation of electricity really is what I'm talking about and then that is coupled then with what I'd call the electrification of the economy so that many sectors that are now operating on fossil fuels transport for example becomes as far as possible operated with you know electric power so all of that is part is one of their key building blocks you know then you've got the hydrogen piece I think is very prospective it's something that's perhaps a little bit further down the track but you know it's this is why you've got to you've got to do all of the above and this is why snowy hydro is so important and indeed the Tasmanian battery of the nation you know plan which is another initiative of mine they that is old technology pumped hydro has been around for more than a century and it you people some of the critics may well be right in 20 or 30 years time there may be some cool way of achieving that and you know storing energy more efficiently but you know what we know we know it works right now and it works at scale and it's something we can do now and so we've got to do stuff in the here and now with proven technology and we've got to work on the new technology as well but right now absent the nag we don't have a suite of policies to get to that target well I think the that's what the energy sector is saying I don't you know I don't want to get into these debates about statistics but what the energy sector is crying out for is settled government policy and they had that with the nag and that was recklessly and wantonly blown up by the insurgents in the coalition and as a consequence of that we have higher emissions and higher electricity prices so and I mean if you think that you know Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly and Erica Betts and all of these characters if you think they know more about the energy sector than you know the energy security board all of the companies in the energy sector industry then you know then you probably do believe Elvis is still with us is it reasonable for us to use carryover credits again well I think it's I think you can use I think it's yes the answer is it's reasonable but and it's you know lawful it's part of the deal but I think we've got to recognize that you've got to do more because you're right I mean the key point you've made Lenore is that this is only one step so if you only get to 26 to 28 percent by using a whole lot of carryover credits how are you going to get to the next level so we're kind of delaying the emission of the boat yeah so you you know I'm not I think it's uh carryover credits are fine but you want to use them you'd want to use them I would think in a way more as insurance uh something to fill in a gap if you don't quite make it you're saying it shouldn't be a substitute for ambition well correct because otherwise if you if you get to 26 to 28 percent with carryover credits then how are you going to get to the next target which might be 35 percent or net zero so so the goal has got to be an electricity sector which is as close to zero emissions as possible and that is achievable but it needs to be planned and now get back to my point about engineering and economics I mean we are in this outstanding circumstance at the moment where the cheapest form of new generation is renewables plus storage but you can't just say that you've got to then do it you've got to make the decisions and the planning you need more transmission you need you know more storage and you've got to plan your grid in a a different way and and you know a lot of the you know the the south Australian blackout in 2016 you know which was such a an electrifying excuse the pun uh moment in Australian politics in this area and you know there were a lot of wild things set on both sides but the truth of the matter is that South Australia moved to the point where it had a renewable generation base which could at any moment generate more than 100 percent of the state's demand and then none and everything was reliant on a big extension cord into Victoria I mean that was crazy you know so what you're now seeing in South Australia and part of that is due to initiatives we took is storage you know there are plans for pumped hydro there are batteries going in there you know the gas peak has have been reinstated you just have to plan it out but I promise you you know we are in this extraordinary moment this is where Ross Garno is absolutely right the opportunity is gigantic to have very you know green and cheap electricity and that and I think that's that's what we need to be addressing so you know ideas like the green new deal and I mean I'm not going into the detail of the American green new deal and I'm not sure that the its authors have either but the fact is that we do have the opportunity of having abundant and cheap electricity which will be zero or very low and could be used for manufacturing and industry in the very regions where the economic pain is being felt most by the decline in fossil fuels right well of course of course it can and the but I mean there are projects I know about I won't breach any confidentiality here but I know about projects energy projects in Australia at the moment that are not being preceded with because of the lack of certainty and clarity in government policy so the government the fact that we don't have the neg and we've had nothing coherent put in its place and it's well over a year which is an eternity in politics and in business that is holding back investment so it's really working against investment and that's what I hear from the energy sector both people who run the companies that generate the electricity and the people who invest in what kind of magnitude of projects well I won't I just say you know more than several because the I mean I well I'll give you an example I was with one talking to one of the largest renewable energy investors in the world not so long ago who said to me they're investing a lot of money in renewables in China but not in Australia I said why not Australia I said why not Australia are too much political risk and uncertainty well there you go in a sense business is kind of agnostic about what the rules are you know but they just there needs to be some coherent rules they need to know they need certainty I mean business doesn't demand certainty in the sense of wanting to be certain about what the exchange rate is going to be or what interest rates will be but you know where governments create uncertainty that is really working against investment and that means it's working against you know all of the good economic outcomes we we want to achieve the government's been threatening to try and create certainty in a different way by expanding secondary boycotts legislation in a unspecified way as yet but in a to stop sort of consumer campaigns and market forces type campaigns against expanding fossil fuel mines is that in line with sort of liberal freedom of speech I think it's I think it's very likely not in line with the constitution you know I mean there've been plenty of cases where people on the you know coalition side of politics have said you know don't bank with this you know this bank because they won't lend money to the coal industry or they won't lend money to this industry or that and I think if people want to say you know don't advertise you know in the Sydney Morning Herald because you you know you disagree with their editorial line that's fine I mean I honestly I think the we've got there's a lot of value well our whole our whole democracy is based on freedom of speech and if citizens want to urge people to advertise in one place or another they're entitled to do that and it's qualitatively different from the whole secondary boycotts if you sort of physically stop someone from going into a shop that's one thing but if you if someone if you persuade someone that's surely something quite different well that's right I mean there is a difference between saying I urge you not to place an advertisement on 2GB because of the appalling abusive language of Alan Jones and actually I don't know interfering with somebody's directly with somebody's business to prevent them doing that you know I mean it is it you are entitled to express a view about the value or the the merits of of other people's speech and encourage people to you know share your views and in how they place their advertising I think it's a freedom of speech issue but I've got to say I I think I mean Christian Porter will have to tread very carefully to get that around the Constitution's implied doctrine of freedom of speech yeah just a couple of questions about the olden times because we must obviously you've been 12 I'm amazed that you can remember them can't you remember I remember I remember them quite vividly so you've been obviously been out of politics for nearly 12 months a bit over a year yeah a bit over a year now so you've had a moment to regroup reflect recalibrate however however you want to express it looking back now what have you learned being being out of no no no no no no no no what have you learned you're outside the crucible now what what what do you think you learned from that period well I've written I've written a book or nearly finished writing a book about which will deal with all of that so that's a bit hard to put into a nutshell but I'm just interested like is there some is there a is there a particular front of mind thought that that is well something is clearer to you now obviously than it was in the middle of that dreadful last few look I I've always I've always tried to focus on the big picture in fact that's what I'm calling my memoir a bigger picture I've tried to focus on the getting the big things right and making sure we make the right the big policy decisions correctly and wisely you know to be honest with you Murfrees and Lenore given the challenges I had and the you know internal opposition I had you know I'm pleasantly surprised that I got as much done in the time that I had as prime minister the amount of things we were able to do you know whether it was on the international stage which I guess you don't need parliamentary support for by and large but domestically was extraordinary given we didn't have a majority in the Senate I mean how many times did you know did you know you and your colleagues and the press gallery say to me why don't you just admit you'll never get this through the Senate and you know I would say oh we'll just let me see how I go and we would get things through the Senate and and so we got a lot done a lot of very valuable reform energy remains an unfinished work but it is because ideology and idiocy has prevailed over engineering and economics and the bizarre thing is it is very much a function of this little bubble that the you know right wing of the Liberal Party operating it's not shared by the state liberal governments it's not shared by industry it is it's a tragedy that such an important area of policy which desperately needs coherent vision and a coherent plan is still adrift so given that you know we're paying for that so but just in terms of my own my own time as PM I'm pleased you know I would have liked to have done the job for longer obviously but I never wanted to do the job forever I might say but I wanted would have liked to have done the job for longer I would have liked to have got some more things done but I got much more done than I ever thought would be possible or anyone else thought would be possible in the circumstances so in that case in that regard I'm a sort of a lucky person so given what the point you just made what are your reflections about the federal Liberal Party as a as an institution of government as well I mean I think you know John Howard raised the issue today I saw you know speech he talked about the problems of political parties not being representative of of the nation or of the people who vote for them I mean winning elections is important right and you can't do anything if you don't win elections granted but equally you've got to deliver the right policies you've got to deliver it's no good you know people used to say to me for example oh you shouldn't talk about innovation people don't like you talking about innovation well what do you think our economy will look like in 10 years time if we don't take innovation seriously I tell you what it'll look like it'll be backward you know we'll and everyone will have a lower standard of living so you've got to be you've got to deliver the right policy outcomes and then clearly make sure you can sell them politically but if your only measure of success is political in the sense of electoral success then you can run the risk of winning a lot of elections and not doing very much and the country is the loser but all parties have to involve compromises between groups of people with different views and you've just said that the Liberal Party had a minority who blocked a really critical issue for the duration and continued to do so is that viable is that well it's I mean it politics is a is a is a relative business I always say it's like football you know you might think you're a pretty scruffy team but if the people you turn up to play against on the weekend are worse than you you win you know labor obviously as I acknowledge lost that last election Scott campaigned very well in all of the circumstances but the coup and the insurgency and Dutton and others put a lot of lead in his saddlebacks but I just but if I could just make you know this point the problem with the right in the right wing group in the Liberal Party is that they operate like terrorists now I'm not suggesting they throw bombs or blow people up or anything like that but their technique is to say unless you do what we want we will blow the joint up and you both have seen them do that on several occasions and that is the that is how they basically intimidate people in the center in the middle to go along with them and that was that was the technique of the that was the you know the technique of the Dutton insurgency if that's the case then how can anybody lead the Liberal Party as a viable policy making it well I think what what you know what Scott is obviously a more socially conservative leader than me but he is not beloved of the hard right at all you know on some issues you know very strongly against gay marriage for example so they would find all of that reassuring but equally this is why he has to tread so carefully I mean you know I have a lot of sympathy for Scott with energy policy I mean he believes the neg is the right policy just as I did just as Josh did I mean it was we developed it together but he is faced with the practical political reality that there are people both inside the party and outside of it who are crazy enough to blow the show up over a sensible policy so they've got to try and find another way to to do it and that's the you know that is the practical business of politics so it's you know you you've got to you've got to try as a leader you've got to try to keep the show together but it is increasingly difficult when you have people who do not accept the consensus you see the whole premise of a political party should be okay we have a diverse group we're a broad church etc we get together we have a debate the majority or a consensus want to do x and so everyone says okay let's do x you know we stick together but what you've now got in the liberal party is that on certain issues the right will say we don't care what the majority thinks we'll blow the joint up but that so that's my question is that a viable operating for a political party it's it's it's via it it it's a big liability there's no question about that but if the if your opponents if the labor party are lesser even less attractive then you can still win elections but it's a but it but it there is no question that the attitude of the wreckers is a real threat to the liberal party um whether it's an existential threat uh and i mean this is i think what john howard was referring to yesterday time will tell now i might say if you put any of this is put to scott morrison he will say it's a bubble issue or he'll he'll try to push it aside and i entirely understand why he'd do that but there is nothing i've said to you on this that he would not he does not genuinely agree with all right because because you can imagine we've been through this we've been through this ringer together with him and josh and other senior members of the government of my government on many occasions i mean this is a a major problem so so so what is your prediction malcolm that he will lead in this term by doing something or by doing nothing just getting back to your well i mean well you're asking me well i don't know i mean scott scott won the election you know with a pretty light agenda but i have to say you know the government's policies in many respects are the turnable government's policies minus turnable you know there's not a lot that is new or different from what uh was part of my government's policy and there's a reason for that scott was the treasurer you know and he was you know we were agree i ran a cabinet government so the people around that table for the most part were fully invested in what my policies were and so naturally they continue but over but you know politics is like riding a bicycle if you stop pedaling you fall off so they have to come up with some new agendas and some new policies but it's going to be well we'll we'll see what they are i mean i think you know i think in a lot of challenges that you're facing you you're dealing with these very difficult identity slash ideological issues and you know the energy conundrum is is one of them last question uh so if as you've said that um that basically the government that's that's in power in camber at the moment led by scott morrison is the turnable government turnable policies with a different well i'm saying i'm saying in in large part it has been i get the nuance right um does that feel fair to you well it's uh i don't think fairness fairness is uh it doesn't fairness isn't uh it doesn't play a huge part in politics well why not uh well i mean i don't know what you mean by fair i mean it's does it feel fair to you that the that the government that's left in camber that just won an election is not headed by you well i would rather that i was still prime minister that's true uh and i don't doubt anyhow i think the election would i'm i you know i'm confident i would have won the election and in and i mean scott's said that you know the reality is the coup was a catastrophe for the liberal party uh as you saw in the results of the victorian state election you know a few months afterwards but you know over time and one of the things helpful things i did was vanish into the background right i didn't hang around trying to destabilize the government like you know other former prime ministers have done but i'm pleased that my i'm pleased they're continuing with snowy 2.0 i'm pleased that the you know 2018 budget uh policy to you know flatten the tax scales for most taxpayers was continued with add in fact enhanced so you know in 2018 the the legislation was you know that by the time that you know all the various steps of the reform had been undertaken people would be paying most people would be almost everyone would be paying top marginal rate of 32 and a half percent with stronger revenues they're able to make that 30 i think that's great uh but what they will now have to grapple with is new challenges that were not anticipated and you know the policies that we had in 2018 uh have been by and large continued well have been continued with by and large for 2019 but you know you're going to have to have some new ideas for 2020 and 21 and so forth thank you so very much for listening we really do appreciate it the executive boy i'm stumbling over my words the executive
