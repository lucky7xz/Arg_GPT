 Victoria's actually had an increase over March last year in terms of full-time employment and total employment. There's about 40,000 jobs missing in New South Wales. Something has gone on. Victoria's actually got more people in work and you've got New South Wales which is the poster child for like how it's handled things but its economy has struggled. Hello lovely people of podcasts and welcome to the show. You are with Katherine Murphy the host and political editor of Guardian Australia and this week we were just chatting actually before we wandered into the podcast to record. It's been longer than usual. That's right, Shane Wright here from the Sydney Mowing Herald and The Age. Thank you. You were going to do the introduction. That's right. You just got sidetracked. I always forget your title. And I'm actually waiting for the official introduction Shane as a good guest would do. Hold on. This is your podcast. I'm the guest aren't I? I'm confused now. We have like 20 seconds and we're already off the rails. Look, yes, Whisby is Shane Wright, all-round lovely person, man of numbers from the nine faxes. Nine faxes. Yes and Greg Jericho, our in-house man of numbers and all-around good person and yes I was trying to say a moment ago it's been a little bit longer than usual since we've been together in the podcast thinking about matters economics but we intend to make up for that briskly. We bloody well want to. I apologize to the listeners because I know how popular these conversations are so let's just hoe in and this is the bit where you tell me what's going on because I've been a little bit preoccupied over the last few months. So why don't we start with you Shane. The economy. What's going on? It's still there. It's still there. It's improving. It's probably back the size it was pre-pandemic. That Rubicon was probably passed five, six weeks ago so yeah we've only lost a year of the game when it comes to GDP but so when we write about the economy roaring back and everything's coming up roses it is if you ignore the fact that yeah a year has gone by since we got into this space that the Reserve Bank has interest rates at lower than a snakes belly and is creating about 300 billion dollars to get things going. Josh Frydenberg and team are running a deficit of yes well they ran a deficit last year of 85 billion dollars. That's a record. They will surpass that this current year it'll be it'll end up 150 hundred and sixty billion but who cares when you're talking about and then next year anywhere between 50 and another hundred billion dollars so an economy with that much stimulus in it that doesn't have bodies piling up outside hospital wards isn't and has effectively trapped every Australian inside the coastline and that has delivered its own form of stimulus. Yeah it's doing all right. Well it's all things considered. All things considered. That's right. It's its own form of downside too in the sense of no tourism no students no which is gets back to the point that we've got this very large artificial injection in the economy. And you also as another consequence is that house prices in Sydney for instance at an annual rate are climbing at 50% which cannot continue if if only for the fact that the Millennials won't rise up and murder every boomer who's staying in the house. Or boomer adjacent. Or boomer adjacent. As Gen X's will just blend into the background as ever. We'll die out here with some black shirts. Just for the record we are not boomers. No one. No one in this podcast just when you come looking for us. Okay good summation Greg. We've got to the point though you know Shane's sort of assessment situation report indicates that there's still a lot of stimulus in the economy at the moment which is sort of floating our collective boats. But some of the stimulus is starting to be withdrawn. Job keeper and the job seeker payments. What do we think do we think that'll be a problem or or is the sort of you know the massive injection sitting underneath all of us is that sufficient to keep us moving past what would be ordinarily one would assume a tricky transition. Yeah tricky transition because it's a tricky economy at the moment and the it's a good question it's a tough question because the economy really is so artificial at the moment I think that's sort of what is behind what Shane's been talking about. I mean how do you talk about an economy and how it's running when you've got the cash rate at 0.1% I mean that doesn't make sense. How do you talk about an economy being strong or employment growing well when you it's because the government is just pumping more money into the economy than has ever done in history and well beyond what anyone would have even considered doing you know in just one year. So it's it's really tough and I think one of the problems we have at the moment is the figures are a little bit laggy because the latest labor force figures which essentially say you know employment is back to where it was a year ago so you know we've got back as Shane was saying we've got back that year we're back where we were March last year so okay we lost a year which is bad but at least in a sense that part of the recession is over but the figures kind of don't make a heck of a lot of sense really when you dig into them it's a weird one because women as we know were hurt the most during the lockdowns and everything in terms of employment but the other ones who have actually recovered better women's employment is up there's about 75,000 more women employed now than there was a year ago and men hasn't changed at all and the reason men haven't changed at all is because full time employment went down about 47,000 for men and part time employment scored up about 47,000 for men now that's a weird sort of thing especially when you then couple it with the fact that underemployment rate for men has gone down even though there's more part-time workers and fewer full-time it kind of the figures don't make a heck of a lot of sense and it's pretty hard to sort of look at it on the sort of the big numbers everything kind of looks good but you think this is there's it's the foundations are not real solid which does make me concerned what's going to happen now that job seekers back to well it's up what 50 bucks at fortnight so you know still not enough but it's all the bonuses gone and JobKeeper especially is gone it's going to have an impact Treasury know it's going to have an impact but I was gonna say you talk about what it's weird numbers wise New South Wales actually people have talked about how greater pandemic Gladys Berejiklian had and how the economy is doing well and yeah Dan Andrews flat on his back the economy in Victoria is in trouble Victorian Victoria's actually had an increase over March last year in terms of full-time employment and total employment there's about 40,000 jobs missing in New South Wales something has gone on and this was you could see this in the state-by-state breakdowns before before the pandemic that New South Wales the jobs figures just weren't good enough relative to what's been going on like the participation rate which tells you that a number of people who are in work or looking for it it's actually about I think it's almost a full point point and a half higher in Victoria than New South Wales so if you look if you try to compare the pair unemployment in New Victoria would be much lower than New South Wales if they had the same participation rate but Victoria's actually got more people in work this is a state that went through that really terrible lockdown and you've got New South Wales which is the poster child for like how it's handled things but its economy has struggled and I don't I don't know if many people were thinking this like there had been all this focus on New South Wales and Victoria the international student issue is really big for Victoria like it's more it as a proportion of its economy it's bigger than in New South so you'd think oh Holland there's something going on there I'm still I'm spitballing this but wages growth in Victoria had been stronger than New South Wales for the last few years for a few reasons just wondering whether there's a bit more money moving around Victoria which has actually helped them relative to New South I don't know like but there's something there is something going on across the Murray River I'm not sure if you could see it in if you're in Albury and looked over at Wodonga or in Tocqueville and looking after Cobram I'm not sure if you'd see it that granular more mildewer Wentworth more mildewer Wentworth yeah something like that but yeah there's something like we're talking about these things there are weird things going on that's just one of those weird things I mean even you know it's it's so hard when you because the figures still don't make a heck of a lot of sense like you look at the GDP figures and you see on there's a 3.1 percent growth yeah that's that's quite a good growth for an annual rate and then you're oh no that's the quarterly growth that we've got at the moment and the annual growth is actually minus 1.1 percent so it's yeah it's you know we're certainly at a better place than you might have thought we would be June July last year when you thought this is gonna take ages to get back to even where we were but it's still you know you wouldn't want to be hoisting the mission accomplished banner just yet because clearly tourism and education sectors are just in disarray still and are going to be for a long time and even when everything is open are people going to come back and yeah tourists going to come back so that's there are still so much weakness and then it's a case of we've got both the monetary and the fiscal sides you know propping up the economy so it's a case of much better than we thought we're going to be but is that just because well we've had really good sort of quote-unquote Keynesian kind of stuff that has actually worked it's an unusual downturn and recovery because both of them are artificial I mean I suppose not it's not through the Keynesian lens in terms of the recovery but if you think about it it wasn't an organic recession it wasn't triggered by a high interest rates or cyclical downturn exactly it was it was a recession that governments generated by by policy decisions to try and save lives so it's an unusual set of circumstances and obviously the recovery is still artificial in the sense of all of those supports anyway it's fascinating though the difference in the numbers and obviously if you're listening and you got thoughts on that get in touch with any of us with you theories about that we are open for business on the socials just one other thing I want to talk about although great Greg gave us a nice segue to the Reserve Bank and but anyway we'll come to the Reserve Bank which Shane's been doing a lot of work on but there's just one more thing vaccination now obviously the mid-year economic forecast had an underlying assumption that there would be a population-wide vaccination program in place by the end of this year now obviously that assumption can't hold when we when we reach the budget in a couple of weeks time so but does it matter doesn't matter this is now quick's not allowed to write about this you're in charge of him telling me he's not allowed to write until I write about this this is my working theory this is just a guy just gonna step out for a little yeah that's right I'm this is my working theory that the biggest stimulus has been the closure of the international border hmm that by trapping people in this country oh I see yeah I'm with you now that that has like the models never haven't been able to take that into account yes so the vaccination input into the modeling I don't think it is as important as actually keeping 25 million people stuck buying Italian bloody coffee machines on eBay which we know they're doing like I think NAB actually reported the other day just this huge spike in coffee machine purchases now I'm not a coffee drinker but I am yet to be convinced that a coffee-led productivity boom is about to engulf this country no but it goes to consumption which is 60% of the economy so I my my working thesis at the moment is that the vaccination isn't as important as the border closure and that my wife the new budget will say right we're assuming this it doesn't matter because if you trap all these consumers inside a country and you've given them shovel loads or bloody wheelbarrow loads of cash which they've got and it's really cheap cash then they're consuming they're finding ways to consume so the state boundary closures are more important because that stops them one of the things I've picked up is that Treasury has underestimated and they admit it now that those short sharp closures the bounce back has been much quicker and again I'm keep keep coming back to what is it is it because we've just stopped people spending money going on big overseas troops we've seen it this helps explain the housing market it helps explain that there's been a 40% increase in this in the price of used cars which has gone on over the last 12 months the fact that last month there was a near record number of Porsche sales that the car market has really bounced back some of that is related to the public transport closures we've also seen but their purchases that if you if Murph wanted to take the family on a trip through India can't do that what am I gonna use the money for I might invest in a house so you can't even say well we'll go to cans cuz you're like I don't know if I trust that I'm not gonna book that cuz what if the border shuts and I have to get home in 24 hours so bugger it we're buying a car all rotten a style and to guess in my friends the quasmas yeah you know you know I mean the good thing is that actually agrees with an article is gonna write on this very you know I mean when you look at the retail figures which are bonkers because there was a huge spike early on which made sense because we were all panic buying like nothing else and everyone was saying oh well that'll come out built a house of toilet paper like honestly we've got out of control you know you don't tell people that shine and that's a beautiful house before the pandemic started I mean it's quite weird I was gonna say something but you know the the retail figures went bonkers April May last year everything we everyone's like oh yeah we're buying we're stocking up you know you just go to Coles and Woolies and there was nothing on the shelves people buy log life milk even though you know you were still able to buy milk there was cows in the country and everyone's thing oh that'll come back and it just hasn't come back because when you break down you look at the hardware stores are going mad all the electronic stores are still going mad everything all that luxury quote-unquote luxury sort of items that are now kind of underpinning it and the grocery sales are back to kind of normal because we're not the services sector hasn't but yes because yeah these are things that you can hold in your hand yeah drive around on the streets mean streets of Adelaide but as same points out that is not a long-term way to recover an economy because how many coffee machines can you own dummy some people say many I don't not an expert in that no I reckon I drink coffee this is a new insight I reckon the Guardian's office could do with an idea couple of coffee I have one question about this though and it's sort of like this consumption binge that you're both describing is sort of just at a level of human psychology right obviously these aren't massive purchases but they are but people obviously feel confident pouches do you know there's a point inside me dance that's trying to come out and it's this so people must feel like they're not going to lose their jobs exactly yeah at this point I think also what it might be as well is you know when you've just gone through the bottom fell out last year and we saw what the government did they said we've got your back we'll come in with a job keep so there's is this sense of okay yes people lose jobs and everything but there's not that sense of if everything goes to hell we kind of a confident that the government's going to which is really interesting save us a bit and so perhaps there is this also bounce back from the world's not going to go to hell yes the vaccination is slower but it's coming things are better so much better than we thought they were going to be so there may be a bit of that I mean I don't want to get into sociological and psychological aspect of it but you're right normally you don't buy cars when if you worry you might lose your job or just and what and we need we need to get onto the bank so just just one more thing on this point right like back to the vaccination assumption now obviously the state public health systems have been very tested over the last 18 months 12 to 18 months so there would be a high degree of confidence in the country that if there were to be an outbreak that state health public health teams contact traces are able to run it down and you know possibly the worst will get will be localized lockdowns but still we do look at India I mean horrendous obviously it's not like for like but look at that look at the situation where we don't have vaccines covering the population and we've got another winter to get through is this exuberance rational you're channeling Alan Greenspan you've gone and we're in a rational expectations that was a subtle intertextual reference which you've it was well look I've been angry at Scott Morrison since he used the term animal spirits yes that's true that is a copyrighted well the fact was he misused it because you can't have the animal spirits of capitalism when Keynes used the term animal spirits in the general theory he was referencing consumers yes individuals see awakened to this now I like look if you're gonna quote Keynes can quote him correctly if nothing else or god what it but then again I'm thinking maybe the PMO just doesn't quite grass I don't know if anyone there has actually read yeah the general theory yeah dummies going anyway whether it's irrational rational if you're sitting in suburban Sydney yeah and you you look overseas okay which is a rational it is rational yes I look at I look at what's going on in the US yes I look at India yeah I look at China I look across through Europe and Africa I look at South America go god this is alright so I don't think it's a rational to think well our system is right like we myself and Eric Bagshaw who's now the age and in SMH is China correspondent but based in Singapore because of our great relations with China we had this discussion very early last year we when there was reports saying all the US system health system best in the world to handle a pandemic and we actually looked at each other no we can see the problem and it was manifested through the Trump administration that that they will fall apart and it came to pass and if you and if you're being told the American systems great and you're looking at what how the Australian systems done you go hold on bloody good place here you know yes this is the lucky country in the fact that we do have we do have a very strong public health system and we're an island and we had a government that threw ideology out of the window very early because they could see and you actually had a good Treasury so that those institutional elements of the country you can call it luck or you can just call it look like it's a learn behavior that the problem though is it's all looking good now because by comparison but if you know after what you like wait on it aren't we meant to be really back to normal yet and it's like this is dragging on and when are we the borders all opening up and then it all sort of we're in a bit of a flush of joy I think yeah it's when you know I can't I don't need the extra coffee machine I don't need the extra Porsche although I'm sure Murph's got enough space in their garage for a three or four but yeah you can see ultimately that you'll get to that point and that's where government RBA policymakers are going right that's where the transition from stimulus keeping everything afloat will will make it to a kind of reality and it's and it's a bit why the RBA is kind of still saying three you know 2022 at least before we're gonna even think about raising interest rates yeah and beautiful RBA segue great thank you for that so Shane you have I'm sure many listeners will be an avid reader of Shane's material but he's done in the parlance a deep dive the first ever into the Reserve Bank anyway there's a surprisingly large number of readers like we have surprised by that writing 10 or 12,000 words on the Reserve Bank these were dark times anyway that's and good on you for doing that and thank you for reading Shane's many words on the Reserve Bank which he's going to summarize for us now Shane that's right yes this has been like we talk a lot about federal federal government policy economic policy but there are two very big arms of economic policy in this country fiscal government and monetary Reserve Bank and as an institution the age in SMH we decided we will finally have a look at how the RBA has gone and ever since Bernie Fraser took over and you the bank in 1989 and you got the inflation target nothing has been written quite like this this is what we got up to with interviewing former governors former board members former treasurers and there's a fairly intense group of academics who focus purely on monetary policy and it was there a consensus what is and what is well there's that I would never argue there's a consensus among economists but in this space the question is whether the RBA was in the wrong space before the pandemic and I think even by the RBA's actions you get to the conclusion they were in the wrong space and what are we waiting for years they had interest rates too high for too long right and didn't act and then you get to this point one or two weeks after the 2019 election where the Reserve Bank decides we're going to start cutting rate so let's go back 18 months the Reserve Bank was at one and a half percent cash rate and halved it in four five months in the wake of the election and then Phil Lowe said governments you need to spend money like this was a concession that the RBA went oops we didn't do it again we've been in the wrong space and now there's this hot there's another ongoing debate about how long does the RBA keep rates on hold does the RBA need to change and this is I went into this saying right I don't have a position on the RBA's performance and everything else but I've come out of it thinking this is every every other central major central bank in the world has reviewed itself and its target in the last five years six years there's one that hasn't and it's in Martin place well it's interesting position it is interesting though isn't it that look I'm losing track of time but Josh Schreidenberg the treasurer did was it two years ago was it 18 months ago I can't remember when he became treasurer a signal that he actually wanted the inflation target reviewed and and it seems logical given that as hard as it is for the three of us in the sort of matrix in which we were raised to understand that inflation is not a thing anymore or at least not at the moment it it seems entirely logical to review whether an inflation target at its current level is the correct policy instrument right it's not even it's not even just the target it's like we have a board that is a group of non-experts and we and this was a planned Ted Theodore when he was treasurer in 1930 this is where these things start that's the type of board we want we our board is exceptionally unusual compared so we get to this point there the board through 2016 50 like they haven't hit the inflation target since 2014 the board sitting there no one holds them to account it's always through the governor yeah but through that period wages growth took a step down it's probably probably one of the biggest pre pandemic issues and it will be that this step down and wages growth in this country the RBA missed it all those analysts that board missed it now how the hell does that come to pass and there hasn't been a reckoning around that there's does the ABS need to have monthly inflation figures which is an issue that we touched on does the board need to be changed there hasn't been a unionist on the board since Bill Kelty resigned in 96 and I've had this some people saying if you had a unionist on the board at least you have someone at the coal face say you've got a lot of guys yeah you're joking if you think wages are going up except you've got these captains of industry who are it's like a caucus or the party room the Liberal Party that they're picked partly on geographical issues and they completely missed it well it's not just a complete mister they completely don't care about I think I think no I don't think they care enough shall we say about wages growth it's not an issue that is forefront and a concern in terms of the economy it's not a priority for them I don't think or it certainly wasn't enough and now they're trying to make it a party and whether the policy can do it is a completely different and it's the I just can't see anyone actually believing that there is really a target band anymore when you know as I've been arguing for a while inflation if we'd been above three percent for this long there would have been alarm bells everywhere and people who were in saying you know there would have been editorials going mad in the odds and the fin review and all that saying what are you doing about inflation it's and yet below it there's been you know no real sense of we got to do so yeah no urgency despite the fact that there were people going have you looked away just recently well I'd like you look at wages and you've had Phil low like this exceptionally unusual the Reserve Bank government are saying governments stop capping public sector wage rises what did the government the federal government and every state government to during the pandemic cap the cap froze them and you go okay you've got the guy in charge of monetary policy half the economy economic debate saying guys you're doing the wrong thing and the other house is only a stuff yeah like it is I really do like maybe this is the craziness of sitting down and discussing in-depth monetary policy for two months with some very bright people but it's maybe sent me a little on edge yeah you see but I still think in that space it is a compelling issue that post-pandemic has has to be examined yeah and it and there's not a lot of what's the word I'm looking for sort of well automated is a stupid word but there's not a lot of I mean look the governor trots up to parliamentary committees and people ask questions that you know may or may not be relevant to this point but that's kind of it really they exist in their own yeah Andrew Andrew Lee for instance when he went to the governor at one of their six monthly meetings earlier this year like saying you've got it wrong like your you've failed on your you've got one KPI hit inflation but man between two and three and you haven't got there like like we've better chance of seeing Carlton win a premiership than we are of these guys getting to that target based on what they've been at and what the problems their problem is actually coming in the next few years as the federal government winds back all this stimulus yeah and this is why the governor keeps saying well we we can't going to lift interest rates till 2023 2024 they want to get the comm exceptionally hot but you've got the other arm of policy going well no we've got to get back to surplus as quickly as possible it's a real tension well it's sort of like if we could summarize this we could sort of say that the old rules really don't work possibly very possibly well that's kind of the context sitting here isn't it that there's sort of been an institutional well complacency again might be too strong a word but almost complacency that you know this is a cyclical this that and the other thing and it'll all come right well it hasn't come right and it hasn't come right anywhere in the world so it might almost be a bit to be a little bit more subtle maybe the old rules weren't actually working things were actually it was almost an accidental working in a sense and we were we were tricked into thinking I that's how the economy's work and everything's fine it's like maybe we were just had a good run and that was an abnormally good run and now we're actually having to do work and and work out how these things work better in the future anyway it's fascinating series I'm sure when we when the pod drops over the weekend reasonable go up no no no no me serious Shane will doubtless share this conversation and I encourage Shane to re-up his RBA series so that if you haven't read it you can read it just quickly because time is a Guinness the budget yay best day of the year tremendous okay the excitement of greg's face it's the budget soon guys okay what's happening in the budget great it's gonna be good for women apparently it's again weird budget because the the figures are gonna be absurd compared to you know that we're not gonna be talking surplus even in the next four years that it's how quickly you know ditch so it's it it might actually which is something I like because the focus on sort of deficit surplus always a bit silly so it might be good and that it means the focus is actually going to be a bit more on the individual aspects of it so what is are they going to do something with childcare are they going to you know do anything with climate change probably not but it means because we're not going to be so worried about oh are we back in the black and things like that it might be actually okay well let's look at this policy is this really a good policy or not so it might be a kind of a weird budget whereas last year it got put off and it was all just you know how we're gonna keep everyone alive and afloat now it's it's gonna be I'm it's gonna be a budget unlike any other that I can sort of think of you said that about the last one well come on yeah but last year was I mean well that was kind of last year again I was saying the best way to go about this is let's have a green recovery and go mad with renewables I'm saying that again and again it ain't gonna happen but you know hey hydrogen is a no gas gas and that's good then you guess Shane what's in the budget this could be the pre-election budget yes yes which if it's not then next year's is gonna be pulled forward and yes I know you hate that but that's life so I nothing would surprise me in Josh Freidenberg actually putting in the out year balanced budget I can see that and then we get into tax like we've we already know after we reported about the Lamington that they're gonna extend it for a year which means they've just put it off the problem for another year so they won't announce what they're gonna do this budget but again in the run up to the next election I think this is it you can't pull budgets away out of elections we go to the women the women's problem and I remember clearly the phone calls we got last year when myself and Katina Curtis wrote front page that complaints that this did nothing for women how dare you mrs. star women drive on roads and my goodness damn a scene conversion has taken place in the last five months well we'll say of course in terms of the substance of but yeah absolutely that is that is right and there's just again not so much because of election timings but because of the sort of sequencing of various reviews we've got a lot of social policy in this budget we've got mental health we've got aged care we've got other things to where they get to an age care is going to be that's particularly interesting yeah yeah and there's an IGR due in about three months oh god yeah which they put back they've reached their own chart of honesty to do it oh my god I know and so if you will all remember sadly the hockey IGR which was the most politicized idea we've ever so it was beyond embarrassing it was yes reality will come back to to how they put it together yeah and I totally forgotten that and that will actually give us a better idea of what the everything that's happened pandemic and pre pandemic and now we'll do longer term to the budget I think I think the IGR may be one of the more interesting documents we're gonna see the population the population well it's sort of dreadful cliche perfect storm population my bit of a productivity problem my favorite stage stage three tax giving people money they don't need yes I don't they need to buy more Italian coffee machine and push no and shaded Shane and I do agree that there is a problem with the company tax rate and potential avoidance in that car boy I pay that point but state street tax cuts are otherwise giving people money they don't need anyway sadly we're at the gong thank you gents I think this is actually the only conversation that we've had and we've had many over the years where we have had no musical references it is I feel deficient yeah I blame you only reasonable we look I promise we'll show up on the other side of the budget Shane is even here with a Kate Bush coffee mug anyway I don't drink that's why all the tenants the tenant that's ten and great yes that's I drink black tea I do ten and honestly serious it's a serious we need a video this just so people can see you know exactly anyway thank you thank you very much to miles Martin Yoni the executive producer of the show and to Hannah Ithard who produces and cuts it thank you to all of you for listening remember if you've got tips on the weird numbers get in touch with us we're all on the socials and a reminder to Shane to up his terrific RBA series we've got a week before the budget yes one more week to go 13 days 13 days until a budget yes so we'll be back next week until then be safe see you then
