 Probably the most important thing on that list from China's perspective is it criticized Australia for speaking out on human rights when it comes to issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang Province and Taiwan or you know human rights and also the future status of those territories. Hello lovely people of podcasts and welcome to another episode of Australian Politics Live. I am Katherine Murphy, Political Editor of Guardian Australia and I'm also the host of the show and with me who's looking slightly alarmed at the moment but I'm sure he'll settle is my lovely colleague in the Canberra Bureau, Daniel Hurst. Yeah well possibly both alert and alarmed but anyway it'll be good. Daniel is one of the reporters in the Canberra Bureau in my wonderful team. He looks predominantly at Foreign Affairs and international issues as well as a bunch of other things and he and I thought it would be productive to come into the Pod Cave and have a yak about that. But it's always so large, I'm laughing because it's always so large, where do you start? Right so anyway let's start with the obvious well I don't know if it's an elephant in the room or the region but it's certainly a large presence in the region at the present time and that's China. Daniel's devoted a lot of reporting hours over the last several weeks really to this unfolding diplomatic standoff between Australia and China. Now for folks who haven't been following this issue minutely Daniel let's just start with what's going on in very broad terms between Australia and China. In very broad terms this year has seen a worsening intentions between China and Australia. The most obvious trigger for that has been the call Australia's call for a COVID-19 inquiry but of course that wasn't the start of it that was just one issue among many and there have been a series of trade actions taken by China throughout the course of this year that has targeted a few Australian export industries including beef, barley and others and in the last few weeks we've seen fears among industry of an increase in those trade actions. It has to be said some of the measures that have been speculated about didn't eventuate but others have in the seafood industry. Lobster exports have had issues, you've seen increasing rhetoric on both sides, you've seen the Australian government in the over the last few weeks demand clarity from China over what they're doing with regard to trade and whether they're discriminating against Australia or whether they're living up to their World Trade organization obligations and then from China's perspective we've seen possibly a shift in tactics where the Chinese government has become more public in spelling out exactly what its concerns are about the Australian government's actions and of course the thing that set the cat amongst the pigeons this week was a list of grievances as it's been called by some that was published in the nine newspapers and on nine news and aired on nine news earlier in the week basically a list of 14 things that the Chinese government is unimpressed with about Australia. A lot of those items wouldn't be of surprise to those who've been following this closely but seeing it all in one consolidated list really did focus the minds. It includes things like the 2018 decision to exclude Huawei from the 5G network, it includes of course the COVID-19 inquiry call. Yeah glad we got back there because you mentioned that right at the start and I don't want to disrupt your flow we'll get back to the 14 things although we may not list all of them but just on that inquiry because again we both know 2020 has been a decade right and some of the people listening to this podcast could have forgotten entirely about this inquiry right so what and given that's what pissed China off not to put too fine a point on it in although as you said right it's it's not just that that was sort of a culmination of things let's just recap that inquiry briefly so what did Australia do that gave Beijing the shits excuse my French. It is excused the Foreign Minister Maurice Payne and then Scott Morris and the Prime Minister both publicly called in April which was fairly early for an international independent international inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and also the early handling of it and called for transparency from China. The Chinese government saw this as targeted against it Australian government and the opposition has to be said in Australia both said this was an unremarkable request that there should be a full review of what went on here to avoid future pandemics or ensure the world's better prepared for future pandemics but Beijing took this as targeted against it it said that Wuhan had just come out of lockdown and it was a bit of an it saw it as offensive and it saw it as Australia backing up the US campaign on the virus which is an important point so we're back to the list of grievances now so the inquiry the independent inquiry was one shutting Huawei out of 5G was another one what else which was in 2018 so it goes back away I won't list them all but there was also an ongoing issue with foreign investment decisions China sees some of Australia's foreign investment decisions blocking particular proposals as being aimed against it or discriminating against it Australia says it follows its own national interest in weighing up those things but probably the most important thing on that list from China's perspective is it criticized Australia for speaking out on human rights when it comes to issues like Hong Kong Xinjiang province and Taiwan or you know human rights and also the future status of those territories yeah so these are issues that Beijing sees as core interest to it to its sovereignty and Australia speaking out on those issues is probably the thing in my opinion that has caused the most angst yes yeah well and it's also seen because the government sort of on a what I would characterize as a still relatively low ish key sovereignty jaunt itself and it's China criticizing Australia's tendency to stick up for rights issues for one of a better term right has led to all sorts of chess beating about well we are a sovereign nation we are a liberal democracy will say we'll stand up for our values nothing wrong with that we should stand up for our values and obviously China is an authoritarian regime that is becoming more assertively authoritarian and that's a big problem right so okay there's a rebuke about speaking out you set them in to go that's critical so it's one of the main sensitivities I would say yeah and why why do you think that's one of the main sensitivities what about that has really caused China to think there's been some sort of major shift in Australia's disposition to be friends well I mean these are issues that Beijing has long held to be its core interests and it goes to its territorial what it sees what it says is its territorial integrity and it's also it's continued rule the Communist Party continued rule across what it sees as all parts of China and so even though China is rising and becoming more assertive and authoritarian it also is quite insecure about some of these issues it's quite concerned about or has been quite concerned about the potential for protests in Hong Kong to escalate and democracy movements to escalate acceptance of Taiwan internationally the status of Taiwan not as a province of not as a region of China but as its own so that goes to those issues but you mentioned about the Australian government's positioning on this it sort of it continues to say it all stand by its values it won't be afraid of speaking out it won't give into economic pressure and it has said that the ball is in China's court for dialogue it says it wants dialogue but ministers haven't been able to get phone calls with their counterparts and that freeze really arose around the time of the covert 19 inquiry call and there's no clear off ramp and I understand from speaking to a Chinese embassy official this week that that isn't likely to change that block on ministerial dialogue unless Australia has to think about how it approaches the Chinese government and the request from China is that Australia has a good hard think about whether it sees China as a threat whether it sees China as an opportunity and so China's to go back to the analogy of putting the ball in somebody's court China's put the ball back in Australia's court and saying we really need a gesture from you to say that you see us as a as a partner rather than a threat and it's it's kind of interesting isn't it that I mean we can talk about partner versus threat in a tick but sort of a couple of weeks though well God I mean here we have the conundrums of 2020 time again possibly it was longer than a couple of weeks ago but it doesn't seem that long ago since we had I think the deputy head of mission from the Chinese Embassy at the National Press Club ostensibly with an olive branch out I mean there were a multitude of different ways you could read some of that speech but it seemed as though only really month or so ago the diplomatic staff in Australia were sort of trying to hit a reset of sorts but yet things have run sort of massively off the rails again over the last few weeks do we know why or is it is it the sort of confluence of lobsters on tarmac sailors sitting off the Chinese coast in ships you know sort of chest beating on either side like what what's sort of I don't know it just seemed like a couple of weeks ago maybe there was some opportunity narrow window of opportunity for a reset that now seems to have passed I could of course be completely wrong so this is the time where you tell me I'm completely wrong about that you're completely right well you're not completely wrong no I think you're right that there have been outreach there has been outreach from both sides but the sort of core if issues the core differences aren't aren't just surface level things it's not just a matter of changing the way something is commented on in one way or the other like this is I think Morrison said this week that it's not a case of just sitting down over a cuppa and sort of sorting out the issues these are deep issues and that list really crystallized that for a lot of people who might not have been paying attention that there's a long list of issues from China's perspective Australia has a long list of issues about its concerns about actions in the South China Sea what's been going on in Hong Kong obviously claims of foreign interference unprecedented foreign interference into Australian politics and a range of things like that and not least of which the trade actions so I can't see a clear off-ramp at the moment because both sides have become so entrenched in in their public posturing on this and I mentioned the change in tactics or what might be a change in tactics from the Chinese side it's not just that list that was issued this week but it was also you know increasingly from the podium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing yes the spokesperson is speaking at length about all the issues not dealing with one or the other but just laying out all the issues they have with Australia and saying it's up to Australia to realize as the spokesperson claimed Australia had spoken out of turn and needs to reflect so there's no clear off-ramp in my opinion it's not about to be fixed and both sides are sort of entrenched in their position and it's sort of interesting isn't it because there is this sort of more aggressive tone to Chinese diplomacy and in Australia more freewheeling plain speaking than exists like I'm sort of bringing a kind of you know an ancient person's perspective to this having been in Canberra reporting at the time when John Howard negotiated a free trade deal with China we are in a vastly different space with our largest economic partner now than we were at that time there was I don't think Australia has ever kind of muzzled itself as a liberal democracy in terms of standing up for values what we would regard as core values but that was always done more Soto Votche it was done directly in conversations between officials and between principles whereas now we've got backbenchers running around telegraphing this every day of the week and also principles in the Morrison government standing up and doing it so it's sort of been there has been this shift both in Australia and China but it's as you say Daniel it's kind of like where's the off-ramp it's not obvious is it but then it sort of plays back into domestic politics right because like China is now sort of framing Australia in these conversations as a client state in terms of those utterances right it's sort of saying here's our list of grievances play nice or we'll turn the tap off on multiple fronts right which makes it harder for that to be taken up exactly see that the hotter it gets on both sides the the more difficult it becomes for governments to maneuver around and I'm kind of interested I'm interested in your views about these obviously we've got a diplomatic standoff between two governments one in Canberra one in Beijing we've got a business community in Australia deeply concerned about losing access to one of its you know most important markets because as I said I'm in to go China's our biggest economic partner right so business community is kind of like oh gosh guys can't we fix this up can't we all hug it out and be friends so that's happening so and then there's the domestic politics as well because standing up and being hairy-chested about an authoritarian country like China it's quite popular in Australia politically so if you Scott Morrison how do you thread those needles huh it's very difficult but it's interesting certainly there is domestic politics at play here in Australia there's also domestic politics of play in China where the one party state wants to maintain its rule and is you know keen to beat its chest and show its strength so it wouldn't want to show weakness on that side Australian government wouldn't want to show weak weakness a lot of backbenchers have been making quite out their comments about China Erica Betts as one example of that where you know effectively demanding a loyalty pledge Chinese Australians that are at a Senate hearing he denies that but you know in this atmosphere there's a suspicion that the contributions from the backbench reflects a broader Australian government position well yeah it would be sort of I guess it's hard for members of an authoritarian regime to understand the sort of loose a dynamic you know liberal democracy that you know it's said by experts on China that China you know in terms of the government they don't like surprises and they can't really fathom freelancing statements that are made you know in some sort of freewheeling values conversation about China rather than a reflective somehow of officialdom so so there are so many complexities here and I understand that China has raised this with Australia some of the contributions of government backbenchers interesting and when China raises that issue the response from Australia is well we're where democracy effectively parliamentarians have the right to speak out it's free speech so that those conversations are happening behind the scenes about the contributions backbenchers are making in commenting about China but there's been no attempt by the government to shall we say muzzle them I would imagine it's unlikely that that would happen given if if they're just doing what they've been requested it's it's unlikely to work hmm exactly okay so there's China a quick detailed summation of where we're up to that leads us to Japan which has sort of been another moving part of the week that I'm keen to get into because weirdly even though it's such an important trip I don't know what it was about this week that sort of minimized it somehow it sort of washed through the system really quickly and by the end of the week we were in war crimes or alleged war crimes in the Barretan report so it just didn't really stick whereas in some of the weeks it would have so if it didn't stick to the extent that you are unaware if we are bringing you the news that Scott Morrison made a lightning visit to Japan this week the Prime Minister went to Japan this week in the middle of the pandemic so let's just start with some basics so obviously there is a new Japanese Prime Minister that our Prime Minister Scott Morrison was very keen to meet Prime Minister Suga what do we what do we know about him well Yoshi Hideo Suga has been a fixture of Japanese politics he was the long-serving cabinet secretary to Shinzo Abe during Abe's reign so basically as Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga was the daily face of the Abe administration he took questions at press conferences once or twice a day from reporters so he was the sort of public advocate for the Abe government's policies he comes from a farming family he doesn't have the political pedigree that Shinzo Abe had he you know has been had been quite active in the past when it comes to trying to prod North Korea to resolve the long-running abductions issue where Japanese citizens were abducted decades ago and there hasn't really been clarity about what happened precisely to them so so while he served as Abe's Chief Cabinet Secretary he was also responsible for pursuing that issue he became really well known in the Japanese public more generally though when there was a change of Emperor when the new Emperor became the Emperor when there was a new Emperor you know took the reins what shall we say and and it was Suga's job to announce the new era name so every time there's a new Emperor there's a new era name in the Japanese calendar system so Suga was the one who got to publicly announce the kanji the character the characters that would represent the new era in in the Japanese calendar and so he became associated with this brand new bright era that Japan was confronting a year or two ago and then when Abe retired for health reasons stood aside for health reasons given his political strength and given his you know public face and he was the continuity candidate Suga took over and you know it's been kind of accepted that or expected that Suga would continue most of the foreign policies of Abe that it wouldn't be any major surprises which has been mostly true so far except for net zero which we will get into climate later which has been a genuine revelation has been fascinating I should say to Daniel sounds very knowledgeable about these things because obviously he's a studious and enterprising journalist but we're very fortunate to have Daniel back in Australia he's been in Japan for the last few years so he knows a lot about Japan and and the internal politics of Japan and obviously about the relationship between Australia and Japan so okay so Morrison in the middle of a pandemic where no one's traveling anywhere no one's doing anything face to face Nick's off to beat Suga the new Japanese PM now why did that happen mainly a signaling exercise I think it's showing a streak the audience is China is one of the audience's but also I mean to the Australian public signaling that Australia is strengthening its relationship with Japan at a time when there's tensions with China Morrison has been trying to solidify partnerships across the region rather than just let's put it crudely putting all eggs in one basket such as China yes so so it's a bit of a signaling exercise at a time of tensions with China and also at a time of change in the United States yes yes we haven't really bought in America yeah and so one of the key issues that they discussed was you know the implications of the incoming Biden administration for the region yeah and of course the rise of China so it seemed like the trip was mainly intended to signal that Japan and Australia were growing ever closer and that Australia was building relationships across the region yeah not just not just sticking to not just sticking to our biggest economic partner so okay so trip ensues signaling ensues that there was there wasn't a transaction to do there was a major item of business will come to climate change in a minute but there was there was a defense pact which was inked in some shape or form but I'm setting up the ink in principle yeah exactly so okay so what is this let's just start with the what is question what is the what is this treaty we'll come back to the sticking point what does this treaty do it's called a reciprocal access agreement and it's designed to smooth the way for Japanese and Australian defense personnel to train on each other's territory yeah and so it's a lot of nuts and bolts really it's it's not so much you know one of these major defense treaties which you know obliges one to come to the aid of the other it's more about the nuts of yeah it's more about the nuts and bolts of you know entry and exit procedures for the for those troops when they go to train you know even to the extent of what tax they might or might not pay and criminal jurisdiction which will come to in a moment but really it's reaching this in principle agreement after I think something like six years of negotiation it's it it's again a signal and it will pave the way for increased defense cooperation between Japan and Australia and there's sort of there's sensitivities on both sides really about troops from either country training on the soil of the other country I mean we can just obviously you know don't mention the war with mentioning the war there's obviously there's obviously that history but also Japan has had difficulties with American troops hasn't it so you're right in saying it isn't answers I mean it isn't but but in in the Japanese context and to a lesser degree in the Australian context it's quite a big deal this thing it is a big deal and you're right that US the last time there was a similar deal was the US status of forces agreement which is something like the 1960s and you know Japan and the US security partners security allies despite that there's been a lot of tension on the ground with locals particularly in Okinawa about the presence of US troops and in certain cases whether US troops are punished adequately if they commit crimes while in Japanese territory so there is that domestic sense about ensuring when troops are on their land that they're brought to justice if they've transgressed on serious crimes which brings us neatly to the sticking point why so why is this inked in pencil rather than in pen because well one of the major sticking point has been the death penalty Japan retains the death penalty for the most serious crimes such as murder multiple murders generally it is on the books and Australia opposes the death penalty and the problem is whether in theory or in practice Australian troops could be subjected to the death penalty if they commit a serious crime while in Japan yes and so that's why we've sort of got yes we're into this treaty and mumble mumble mumble we'll work out the fine print later how do you work out that fine print very difficultly it's not clear exactly how they've resolved it the ABC reported that they'd gotten around it by saying that each case would be dealt with on a case by case basis mmm-hmm law accounts of Australia is not happy about that it's a principled position to oppose the death penalty you can't be having it women you know you know when it happens the fudge is when it happens we'll have discussions and you know yeah exactly you know please don't subject them to death penalty okay well noted there is some we're told that there is some mechanism to ensure that the international legal obligations of both sides is respected but we don't know what that means and we won't know what that means until the legal text is released probably next year so it's not going to be signed properly till next year when Prime Minister Suga is expected to visit Australia but we don't know no we really don't know yeah it's fascinating to and well they're obviously still on the path to resolving it otherwise you would have had your pen out rather than your pencil out so okay so that's a watch this space obviously we'll bring you up to date with that once once we actually understand what's going on there we'll be happy we'll happily bring you up to date with how on how we sort of swerve around the death penalty anyway the other thing we mentioned a minute ago which is the sort of bit of the bulk from the blue which is Suga stance on climate change so let's tell the listeners about that what's happened well like Australia really the Arbe administration had a goal of reaching net zero emissions was a language along the lines of as soon as possible in the second half of this century Suga came along and very quickly announced a major policy commitment which was to reach net zero by 2050 which is what the scientists say is needed no quite and climate change it happened didn't it sort of the maybe my timing slightly off but it happened around about a week before the American election it was I think it was late October so yes yes right it was very very it was in the in the shadow of the US election and was sort of interpreted that net zero commitment commitment was interpreted at the time of Japan positioning for a change of administration in Washington because once there we one thing we haven't foregrounded America's kind of come and gone in this conversation but Joe Biden the incoming Democrat has much stronger policy commitments on climate than his predecessor Donald Trump or you know soon to be predecessor Donald Trump assuming he ever found that's what he was oh that's not let's not go there okay so that happened the week before or thereabouts before Biden was elected this net zero commitment now obviously Australia is now saying we love net zero except we won't say when we get there and we won't do anything unless we can tell people how much costs so how was that finessed between the two leaders during Scott Morrison's flying visit in short they both acknowledged each other's policies that's what the official document said so Morrison as you say in Parliament in Australia after the US election and also on this trip to Japan has been sounding more and more like a subscriber to net zero but without saying where the timeline is important the time I support it but what Morrison told Japanese business leaders and Prime Minister Suga by all accounts is that Australia shares the goal of net zero emissions we just can't give the time frame yet by the way we'd like to cooperate with you on hydrogen we'd like to cooperate with you and help with low emissions technologies and Morrison mentioned a favorite aspect in all these talks carbon capture installers yes well Japan's had to sort of get out of nuclear hasn't it and after the Fukushima disaster and is sort of embarking on its own energy transition as well so so that's a kind of interesting backdrop to that it's because they actually had an increase in fossil fuel use straight after Fukushima because the nuclear plants all went offline yeah but then like like in Australia increasingly businesses moving some proposed coal fired power stations in Japan was ceased like the proposals they'd been proposed but then they got axed in the last few years yeah and increasingly there's pressure for you know climate risk to be assessed so there's that momentum moving and Japan even though you know part of the net zero pledge includes reliance on nuclear there is increasing emphasis on renewable energy and yeah which is fascinating and it's sort of like I guess to square multiple circles we've we've had visits during this podcast to China Japan and America as well as here it's sort of like the net zero pledge kind of is a gesture well I mean it's a thing I desperately hope it's a thing because we need it to be but it's a it's a gesture to the new Biden administration and its priorities on the part of the new Japanese administration right we're on board for climate action but it's also not withstanding nice diplomatic words around respecting or acknowledging one another's policies there's sort of critical risks economic risks let alone you know let's set aside climate risk for one sec and just talk about economics for Australia we had China move in a net zero direction we had South Korea move and we had Japan move in a relatively short space of time again I think largely anticipating more momentum being back into the global climate discussions we should go briefly to Britain because of course Boris Johnson has been about on the phone to trying to lobby for action because Britain is the host of the Glasgow international climate talks at the end of next year so so that's all happening so then but then Australia a big fossil fuel exporter big exporter of gas big exporter of coal is looking at a proposition where it's major export markets for our favored commodity you know on the way down and on the way down in that trajectory that many people listening to this podcast will see in their lifetimes yeah it's not gonna stop tomorrow but it's definitely the trajectory is clear yeah and Japan South Korea China they're all major buyers of gas and coal these are things that the shift needs to be taken into account in Australia we you know it's looking more like we're getting isolated on these issues and it's not just that as you say the economic impact if we don't embrace the change and create jobs in the renewable space and technology to tackle climate change we're in deep shit as it were anyway that's a fairly crude note to end on but let's let's end there Daniel thank you for this chat I really do appreciate it thank you to Miles Martin Yani who's the executive producer of the show thank you to Hannah we'll be back next week
