 The Guardian I feel like I got talked to you because you got the headphones on No, you can talk to me So sunny Yeah I put on tights under my jeans because I was like, oh it's going to be like 3 degrees outside and now I'm boiling So, where are we off to today? Well, Danielle, we're off on an exciting journey down the road from the office to visit a VR arcade called DNA VR As someone who works in video games, I'm often asked whether or not virtual reality is the future of gaming But I'm notoriously sceptical, so much so that when I had a launch party for my book, 10 Things Video Games Can Teach Us one of the attendees took the opportunity to have a go at me for a television appearance in which I made the honest observation that using a VR headset makes me feel sick What else do we know? We know that they have multiple VR headsets and that you can, I think you can book it out for functions and things so it's very much supposed to be like a place people go with groups of friends to have that kind of social experience which is weird because VR inherently doesn't seem like a very social thing you know, because you put on a headset and you put on headphones and you can't see or hear Virtual reality has some interesting applications in news and even in healthcare but as a gaming platform it has its issues, even if you don't suffer from simulation sickness It's isolating, shutting the player off from the outside world and it's expensive One way VR can be made more accessible to those who can't afford their own headset is through public spaces like VR arcades So would a tour of one of these arcades convince me? You excited? Not, even remotely And are they the future for virtual reality gaming? This is Tips With Everything, I'm Jordan Erika Webber It doesn't look very welcoming, I've got to say There's a small sign, a big wooden door and a metal grate Oh, it's open Oh my god, it's dark So this is it, ok Hello How are you? How are you? Matt Mayer is a VR game master who has worked at the DNA VR arcade for the past four months The main role I have here is as customer support tech support So I will help customers set up when they come in by giving them a run through of the controls helping them set up the games themselves and if anything goes wrong during a session I'll be monitoring it But if you're expecting the traditional arcade experience, you'd be wrong So this room is, I see blue cubes basically with blue curtains in front of them and each one has a little bean bag and a headset in it It looks like kind of a weird warehousey type deal So this room with the blue cubes is the escape room and presumably each person in the group goes into a different cube Exactly It seems a bit weird to get people, you know, people who are friends in real life into the same physical space and then to kind of divide them up so that you can put them back in the same space in the virtual world Well the only way, the only reason we do it is because it, well there's two reasons A, the sensors need some physical object blocking otherwise the sensors will pick up different headsets and different controllers and it will just glitch out and there's the, like they can't see what they're doing, issue so they bump into each other or punch someone Has that happened before? In the group room, yes It's happened to me as well So the escape room games sound like a fun way to socialise with friends but I wanted to try a more traditional VR gaming experience So Matt took us to the group room where people can pass a headset around and a big screen shows them whatever the player is seeing It kind of reminded me of a karaoke booth and Matt said it's popular for group hangouts or even dates If I didn't work here I'd probably come here Yeah, okay Fair enough I had my girlfriend come here once and I put her on a really scary game After like one second she was like nah I've had enough of this So romantic And I've called Fruit Ninja Did she like Fruit Ninja? Yeah Okay A good come down And it was Fruit Ninja I played first Yeah I was going to ask about that actually because I wouldn't want to put on a headset that other people had been using really Yeah But presumably you... Me love face masks that we swap over literally every session Ahh okay I feel better about that I have a very small head It caused problems with the PlayStation VR when I first tried it So that's alright Matt? Yes And this is the HTC Vive? Yeah Okay, do you know why you're using them instead of Oculus or... I think it's better, it's easier to use The controllers are a lot more like user friendly If you're playing a shooting game it turns into a hand with a gun If you're playing Fruit Ninja it turns into hands with swords Like it feels very natural I guess It like tricks your eyes and your senses very quickly I get motion sickness from all VR, also cars You know buses, so pretty much anything I'm very susceptible So yeah you said you are pretty sure I won't get sick Are you saying nobody gets motion sickness in this place? I've never experienced it on any of my bookings If people do say they've got motion sickness or are uncomfortable with the idea of playing something too fast I'll just recommend the basic games to get started with I mean most of the time I will offer like the most straightforward games with the least movement just to get a feel for it So Fruit is flying at me and I'm waving my hands around in mid-air because I have two swords I don't know which one is supposed to go in which hand but I presume it's fine I don't give these a right handed or left handed sword and I'm just cutting Fruit in half The arcade had quite a few games on offer but one that jumped out at me was Job Simulator which friends have recommended me before It's a funny, cartoony game set in the future where you play as a robot pretending to work various human jobs I started out as a mechanic Hello human, this is an accurate simulation of Auto-Mechanic Take a look at this board for instructions Can you believe I'm stepping out of the way of a virtual car? This one just needs a little fluid, no problem So if you look at that screen it tells you what to do Oh yeah, okay I need to find some fluid to go in the fluid thing The fluid looks like oil? No? Are you enjoying it? Um, I probably should have picked the chef one because turns out I don't know anything about cars but this is quite cool I like the being able to physically reach out and pick stuff up Do you want to swap it to the chef one? So if you press the menu button The top one I feel like you should be playing this, Daniel Even though humans spend the entire night in a state of low power consumption they still require food energy as soon as they wake up Baking an egg provides a high energy taste ratio It's so messy Now put your creations on the plate and you can ring the bell to send it out to the restaurant Take out the egg and don the pipe It's not done It is? Oh, okay Everyone's getting pretty well done Don't worry, we'll serve it anyway So I'd made a smoothie and burnt some eggs and I was starting to feel a bit unwell It was time to put down the headset and go back to my real job Alright, so how do you feel? I feel sicker than I did when I took the headset off Which kind of goes... Given my susceptibility to simulator sickness and my mild germaphobia I don't think virtual reality arcades are for me but I could see the draw for other people So I wanted to hear more from one of the people behind DNAVR Why did he decide to open it in the first place? We've been always big fans of escape rooms and therefore we were always in search of something like an escape room but maybe more immersive More on this after this break Hi, it's Daniel Glaser here Our latest episode of A Neuroscientist Explains looks at an issue in the world of psychology the so-called replication crisis People read that and said that cannot possibly be correct So either something's broken about the scientific publishing process or everything we've ever known isn't true Psychology, and science in general, is self-correcting but only if we actually do the correcting and it's great to see that there's more emphasis on doing this correcting and being sure about our hypotheses To have a listen, head over to theguardian.com forward slash podcasts or search A Neuroscientist Explains on your favourite podcast app Welcome back to Tips With Everything. I'm Jordan Erica Webber Before the break, we took you on a tour of London's DNA VR arcade I had fun chopping up fruit as both a ninja and a gourmet chef but I left wondering if this type of arcade is really the future of virtual reality gaming Hello Hello Hi, is that Alex? Yeah, hi speaking Hi, this is... Alex Surupa is the co-founder and director of DNA VR So neither of us has any previous experience with VR so we were exploring this kind of business as it emerged I was curious, what makes someone who doesn't come from a VR background want to create a VR arcade? We've been always big fans of escape rooms and therefore we were always in search of something like an escape room but maybe more immersive and then we came across these VR escape rooms and we thought hey, that sounds like a really good idea how about we introduce a place like that ourselves and maybe make it more social because normally VR is associated with very tech enthusiasts and we wanted to introduce this to a more general public How long did it take to set up the arcade then? The set up process was quite quick, I would say, no more than two weeks Building the arcade itself wasn't too hard and wasn't too long but making sure that all the equipment works perfectly fine without any interaction and necessary interaction, that was a hard bit I think we spent about a month on that as well How do you decide what kinds of games and experiences to offer in the arcade? We tried everything ourselves to make sure we are providing the best games possible and the best experience so everything was tested multiple times by ourselves and also with our test guests as well What kinds of games and experiences are you looking for? We are mostly interested in multiplayer games and anything that can make the experience as social as possible We are looking for multiplayer shooters or maybe VR escape rooms where you can interact, you can shoot each other or you can throw boxes at each other we can solve puzzles together That makes the experience less of a geeky experience, more of a social set up One of my big problems with VR is that I get sick when I play it So how do you compensate for that? Yes, we deliberately didn't include any of the VR roller coasters into our selection because we ourselves experienced motion sickness and we thought that we, as most of our customers, are actually first timers we didn't want to ruin their first experience with motion sickness That's why we are selecting only the games and experiences that are associated with a lower risk of having it You say on the website that DNA VR is London's first VR arcade Why do you think it was the right time to bring this kind of thing to London? I think that London is a great city that has so many different experiences and yet every Friday you end up in the same car per cinema and we thought that, well, this is the point where the technology is already there but nobody really knows anything about VR, even ourselves Even though we are quite tech focused in our daily lives We haven't really used VR for a long time So we thought, hey, there are no other companies on the market yet so it's probably the right time What kinds of people come to the arcade? What demographic would you say it's most popular with? It's very hard to answer that question mostly because there is no distinct demographics I would say that we always have a lot of corporate events like with bankers or consultants or people from all those very traditional backgrounds who come in groups like 20, 25 and they have amazing time because they don't expect much We do have some gamers every now and then but I would say that most people they have actually never used VR before and for them it's really something very new like many people come on their first dates for instance What do you think is the draw for customers? What makes someone decide to go to a VR arcade? Yeah, I think that's definitely something that most of them haven't ever tried before but also at this point having a headset plus a very expensive PC is not affordable for a lot of people and probably doesn't make sense if you don't do that every day if you're not a gamer Now when it comes to more traditional video game arcades they kind of were negatively impacted by the rise of home consoles So when people started to have video game consoles in their own homes they didn't go to the arcades as much Do you think that there's a risk that the same thing will happen with VR? Perhaps as it gets cheaper, do you think people will just go home and buy their own headset and then VR arcades won't need to be around? Well with the business model like ours, definitely yes So we understand, definitely find that this model won't survive for a very long time because exactly the headsets are becoming cheaper On the other hand, many people come for groups of 10 or 20 and they don't necessarily have a headset at home and also this particular project is just the beginning for us because we want to see how the market develops, what the customers are looking for and develop our own experiences where, like with free roaming, which you can't really implement at home So what do you think the future of VR arcades is then? Well my metaphor for this would be like having a laser tag but in VR So for instance if you have a heat warehouse where you can walk, you can interact with objects but everything is happening in VR so you see things that cannot be easily implemented in real life that would be probably the future So for people who don't want to shell out for a virtual reality headset of their own or have access to one through work like I do VR arcades are a great way for most consumers to try out this still developing tech especially if you want to play in a group and it might have made me feel a bit queasy but I'm still going to get a copy of Job Simulator for myself My thanks this week to Matt Mayer and Alexander Serupa for giving me a tour of their VR arcade and chatting to me about the future of this gaming medium You can find a link to DNAVR in the description for this episode on the Guardian website And to thank you for listening, we're going to start adding an interesting tech fact from the week that we thought you'd like to hear about This week we look to Fashion Giant Chanel MIT Technology Review reported that Chanel's 6 3D printers can produce 50,000 mascara brushes per day If you have any interesting tech facts for us, questions or feedback on the show or ideas for cool digital stories that we should cover in future episodes email us at podcasts at theguardian.com I'm Jordan Erika Webber, see you next time
