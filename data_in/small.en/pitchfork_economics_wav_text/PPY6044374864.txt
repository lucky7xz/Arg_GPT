 Republicans are seen as taking care of the economy better because they are better at telling the story that they're on your side. Increasingly there's this giant band between that poverty threshold and the top 10% and those people can't survive. We don't talk about economic policy in terms of what is best for the broad swath of Americans. Medicare for all is centrism. Raising the overtime threshold to include the bottom 80% of workers is centrism. Moving the minimum wage up to the median wage is centrism. These are centrist ideas because they will unambiguously improve the lives of the median family which should be our goal. From the offices of Civic Ventures in downtown Seattle, this is Pitchfork Economics with Nick Hanauer where we explore everything you wished you'd learn in Econ 101. I'm Jessen Farrell, Senior Vice President at Civic Ventures and former state legislator from Northeast Seattle. I'm Nick Hanauer, founder of Civic Ventures. Nick, do you remember that day that we had a staff meeting in your office and you had this yardstick sitting on your couch? What was that all about? The yardstick was this super useful prop that we've used a bunch of times and have even brought to meetings with politicians to demonstrate the difference between ideological centrism and true centrism. The reason the yardstick is so useful is that it's a really easy visual metaphor for people to figure out what it means to talk about the center. If you take a normal yardstick and if you were to imagine putting every single American on that yardstick from the very poorest person on the left all the way to the very richest person and you were to try to find the center of that yardstick, if you go by weight by pounds you would find the center right in the middle about 18 inches. But if you were to find the center, the fulcrum of that yardstick based on wealth shares and put 50% of the wealth on one side and 50% of the wealth on the other or 50% of the income on one side and 50% of the income on the other side you would find at the balance point the fulcrum about three-fifths of an inch from the right. It's sort of you know more than 35 and a half inches. And so the literal visual that you had was you were holding the yardstick you know on your couch and you were like pointing at the far end. That's what we're thinking of. Exactly and we call that the neoliberal yardstick which finds the center, centrism, balancing the economic interests of the people who own half the wealth which is about 35 and a half inches from the right against the economic interests of everyone else in the economy on the left. And that's what passes for centrism or what Howard Schultz likes to call moderate economic policies which is to say what we're going to continue to do is the same vicious, exploitive trickle-down policies which have enriched the few and impoverished the many and occasionally will throw a bone to poor people at the very bottom of the economic spectrum. What that version of centrism does is it leaves out the people basically in the middle eight deciles or largely in the bottom nine deciles. Almost everybody else. It makes rich people richer and everybody else poor. And thus this great literal metaphor was born. So we've been using that as a way to think about stuff and I in reflecting on some of the work that I've done as a legislator I was part of the negotiating team on the paid family leave bill and the impulse always is to start on that far end or rather I should put it this way to start in the middle which is to say that we are representing we have an idea that represents the vast majority and over time in the legislative process it gets whittled down and whittled down and the so-called compromise or centrist position ends up being that thing that doesn't benefit the vast majority of people in the state. And you see that happen over and over and over and over and over again right and so what's really interesting is that in our heads as we think about politics and economics we've persuaded ourselves that centrism means just a little bit. Or a policy that helps just a few people that's centrist and a great example of that is that if we raise the minimum wage just a tiny bit from $7.25 an hour to say $8 or $9 that's centrism. Right. And raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour or even $20 an hour that's crazy lefty. That's right. And I guess our point is nothing could be further from the truth if you raise the minimum wage to $20 an hour it would benefit almost I think about 65% of Americans today earn less than $20 an hour maybe less than 70% of Americans. And so in that sense because the policy would benefit seven in ten Americans that seems like centrist to me. Like that's benefiting the people at the center of the economic spectrum. Another great example is that one of our favorite policy issues is the overtime threshold. Right. So today it benefits just 7% of salaried employees people who make below $23,600 a year. You know sort of the Orthodox way of thinking the neoliberal way of thinking about centrism would be to raise it from $23,600 to what the Trump administration just did to $35,000 benefiting you know 15% of American workers or 20% of American workers. But what true centrism would be is to move the threshold up where it benefits 60 or 70 or 80 percent of Americans to the $70,000 or even $80,000 level. And so what we've got to get people to recognize is that economic policies that directly benefit the vast majority of citizens that's true centrism. And it builds like broad political popularity and support of the idea. Right by the way this truer way of thinking about centrism is both great economics but it's also great politics because if you're a politician and you're talking about policies that benefit eight or seven out of ten of the people that you bump into every day, well that's great politics. And again I think one of the reasons that so many people today justly believe that Democrats are feckless corporate stooges too is that we really haven't as a party stood for anything other than policies that generally make rich people richer and occasionally will throw a bone to poor people. Yeah I can think of two really concrete examples in the in the state legislature. In Washington State there was a time when public college education was affordable for almost everybody. When I was at the University of Washington in the mid 90s my quarterly tuition was $690 a quarter. Yeah. Right and so that's broadly accessible for most people and over time it went way up and one of the big scandals in 2014 in the 2014 session is that the Republicans had proposed a tuition cut and the Democrats felt so scooped by it because they were the Republicans weren't supposed to be the people who were advocating for the middle class but Democrats were so reflexively unable to think about policy from that broad-based what is it that's gonna help the most people and certainly affordable college tuition is one of those things but we just could not think about it that way. So Jess and you raised a great example of the Democratic Party being on the wrong side of an issue and I want to just acknowledge that I often am too partisan in this podcast. I often equate being a Democrat as being a good person and being Republican as being a bad person and that's that's nonsense. Certainly it is true that the Republican Party has gone off the rails in many many ways but we should you know clearly acknowledge that as Democrats we have done a terrible job over the last 40 years in taking care of the economic interests of most people and the point of the podcast isn't to promote Democrats it's to promote economic ideas that people in both the Democratic and Republican Party can embrace to make people's lives better and you know you just raised a great example of a place where Republicans were probably on the right side of the issue and Democrats weren't and I certainly feel like I need to be more careful in the podcast to not be so overtly partisan even though I strongly believe that at this moment in time Democrats are on the right side of most of these issues and Republicans are just sort of reflexively on the wrong side. Except you know Republicans are seen as taking care of the economy better and I think part of that is because they are better at telling the story that they're on your side they're on my side well they are literally on your side. Yeah sorry that's not a good one but you know on the side of the middle class right and whether or not that's true part of it is that we don't talk about economic policy in terms of what is best for the broad swath of Americans and that's your point about centrism. That's right and putting a lie to the claim that if you're making rich people richer that's better for everybody and the Republicans have been great at telling this trickle-down story the neoliberal story that what's good for rich people is good for everyone and that theory of growth beats no theory of growth which is where the Democratic Party has been for a very long time. And so that brings me back to that day in the office where you had brought this yardstick and we were all scratching our hands wondering what you were doing with the yardstick and you started talking about this idea of the center being the thing that benefits the vast majority of people and from that coming this article Democrats must reclaim the center by moving hard left. Yeah that we did in Politico in August which you should read dear listeners. It's a great article. Google that. Democrats must reclaim the center by moving hard left. Exactly and then how far we've come right so we put this idea out into the world and now we are debating is Bernie Sanders a centrist. One might argue free college free community college free college that's a centrist. Yeah free health care Medicare for all or health care for all centrist. Yeah yeah we have come far. We have come far. Yeah and so today we get to talk to our friend Pramila Jaipaul. It's one of the most remarkable members of Congress who definitely understands these issues of centrism in a way that few people do. Yeah she is just a complete rock star as the first Indian American woman to serve in the House of Representatives. She is the first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She is one of the best organizers in the country. Yeah. You've seen it on her work on local issues whether it's raising the minimum wage. A long-time collaborator of ours here in Seattle. Exactly. Yep and you see it on her work in Congress organizing those Congress people into having a really strong progressive stance and a strong progressive institutional mechanism which she is really invigorated and worked towards. It's really exciting to see her. So we're just gonna begin to chat. Yeah. And this is gonna be both a podcast and a catch-up. Okay okay okay. Pramila and I go way back. We did a lot of fun things together of the years in Seattle where she's from. Among them the $15 minimum wage and I should just say that it was really that was a journey. It was a journey and a learning experience and for my own part you know one of the things that I was as I reflect back on that experience you love to think about what you thought was right and what was wrong and where you were wrong and I one of the one of the ways in which I was most wrong were my views on tipped workers. I remember that. Yeah and you know I came into that conversation into that effort feeling pretty strongly that tripped workers should be treated differently than other workers and Pramila and a bunch of other people strongly disagreed with me and I could think I can say safely and confidently now that I was dead wrong about that. I think that's pretty amazing I mean I just feel like it you know we're fortunate to have you in the region and to be able to have this conversation around not just what is the right policy but also what is the right language and we've used some of your you know I've been testing the centrist idea and taking back the use of the word centrist which you wrote an excellent essay on and you know and I'm constantly trying to tweak it but I think that's the that's the value of these conversations and 15 I feel like there isn't even a conversation now here in Congress that 15 is the right level and that's you know like high-five on that because we totally we did that and not we just you and me but we the movement and fast-food workers and low-wage workers across the country who have changed the reality and so I'm here in Congress because I believe that if politics is the art of the possible then our role is to try to push the boundaries of what is seen as possible. I just wrote a piece on the working poor and I was thinking about this idea that really what we have to do is transform the way we think about workers so that workers are not the drain on companies but they are the valued engine of profitability and growth for companies and that and then taking your same narrative again but that is a dynamic shift in how we see workers because people say oh no we can't increase the minimum wage or we can't give people benefits or we can't do this or we can't pay overtime because it's too expensive but no actually you don't get growth if you don't have workers who are driving that growth and so the profits have to be shared in a very different and equitable fashion than they have been. Absolutely and I think what you're talking about is strictly not neoliberalism I would say. Right. So you know one of the most profound lessons of organizing for the $15 minimum wage just sort of pathetically obvious when you consider it is that contrary to a lot of instincts from activists on the left in a weird way the farther we went the easier it got this is one of the profound lessons of the $15 minimum wage is you can't have a fight for $775. Right totally I totally agree with you it's like and now you know we've I mean 15 felt far at the time but it's really not far enough right I mean if wages had kept pace with inflation we would be at 21 22 and depending on what state you're in more than that and so. But you know if you raise the minimum wage from $725 which is the federal minimum to $775 you help a few people in the bottom one or two deciles in 2012 when we first started talking about this raising the minimum wage of $15 an hour included the bottom 45 percent of workers or something like that it may have been slightly more so you absolutely have people's attention and that lesson has turned into a new conversation that you and I have had about what the true meaning of centrism is because what 40 years of neoliberalism taught us taught the Democratic Party if we're being honest is that centrism is found when you balance the economic interests of the richest people who hold 50% of the income against everyone else in the country who owns the other 50% of the income. Well and this came about because I think I was at a conference where I was talking about how these progressive policies aren't really progressive there I mean I'm proud to be called a progressive but they're not radical and I think you said no they're actually centrist because they serve the center of the country why should centrism mean that the top 1% of the wealthiest corporations are getting all of the benefit why wouldn't centrism mean serving the center and I love that because I was an English major in college and I was thinking about etymology and I'm like yeah centrist should mean center and so I've been taking that around the country and trying that I used it as speech in Iowa I've used it in some places and we still have to tweak it a little bit but I think so the opportunity of that is that there is a fair amount of research that shows that people love these progressive ideas whatever you want to call them right these these ideas we're talking about minimum raising the minimum wage overtime pay yeah fair wages reasonable health care costs affordable college a decent place to live that doesn't bankrupt you it's so weird how people prefer those things it's it's amazing right and it's not just progressives or young people it's actually Republicans and independent everybody everyone wants the same thing and sometimes there is this push to say well this person is progressive but you know I started a Medicare for all pack and I actually endorsed a couple of people who are not in the progressive caucus but ran on Medicare for all and I think we do have to think about you know and there are some people who are like no don't say centrist because that's talking about the centrism that is but we've reclaimed a lot of words in our narrative I mean we've done that on racial justice we've done that on so many things we can reclaim this and make centrism mean center serving the center not serving that fulcrum right and and you know like we of course need to always be thinking about taking care of the least that the most disadvantaged people in our society but it is a terrible political policy and economic mistake to make the rich richer every day and occasionally throw a bone to the very poor our policies should directly unambiguously and significantly improve the lives of the bottom nine deciles of Americans who have been left out of the last 40 years of economic growth and to me that's what centrism is Medicare for all is centrism raising the overtime threshold to include the bottom 80% of workers is centrism moving the minimum wage up to the median wage is centrism these are centrist ideas because they will unambiguously improve the lives of the median family which should be our goal right and so much of what's happened as inequality has grown is that yes we have these programs that serve the most vulnerable the poorest and we need to have those but increasingly there's this giant band between that poverty threshold and the top 10% and those people can't survive they have been forgotten they have been forgotten and if you look at the statistic that I that keeps me up at night is 62% of Americans don't even have a thousand dollars in their bank account 45% of Americans can't even deal with a $400 emergency that's a leak you know in your roof that's your car breaks down that's your kid gets sick and you have to take a couple days off from work and you don't live in Washington State where you get paid medical leave it's any of those things and so this anxiety is ever present for 90% of people and for me that also is the opening for then the blaming that somebody like Donald Trump taps into right because he taps into working people who feel like they've sort of been doing everything right like they got a job they're working 40 hours a week now more and more they're working two jobs you know they don't have money to send their kids to college because education is so costly now they are worried about their Social Security because they're afraid it's gonna be cut they're one health care crisis away from bankruptcy housing has gone through the roof they can't pay for housing and they're like wait a second you want to talk about immigrants what about me you know and so it leads to this this place where people get divided and I think the more we can point out that the only people that benefit from any of the rhetoric the divisive rhetoric or the cuts to Social Security or any of these things are the people at the very top very rich people for sure myself included I should add so unusual because you're willing to say that and I will say that there there are and we have some of these folks in in Washington State a lot of really wealthy people who don't want to have this either they know that your future is not going to be good if if we devolve into a country where literally only 10% of the people if that have opportunity yeah if America falls apart it will suck to be rich to revolution yes who's gonna be the target of that actually so how do we talk the Democratic Party and ideally a bunch of the Republican Party into this notion that the purpose of politics is to unambiguously improve the lives of the median family like I would just admit that I'm about to have dinner with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and a bunch of people to talk about the future of the Democratic Party and one of these big dinners what should I say to them well I think you should first of all point out that people won across the country and we took control of the house because of bold ideas not because anyone was talking about a 25 cent increase to the minimum wage but because people were talking about even in swing districts ideas like Medicare for all I think you should talk about the centrism of these ideas I think you should talk about the fact that we have a situation of crisis where people don't trust either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party because there's so much money in politics now it'll be awkward because you'll be at a dinner where which is you know about donors to the Democratic Party but I think that you know we have some big pieces of legislation around anti-corruption but I also think for me I don't know if this is something you want to say tonight but for me one of the things that I've been trying to do is think about how you use elected office to to drive a conversation and to drive a narrative versus following a bunch of polling that is often not useful but also not just right because because if you look at and not that I want us to do what Trump is doing but if you look at what Trump does he just has a narrative and then he pushes that out there you know after the Kavanaugh hearings all of a sudden it was all about the unfairness to Kavanaugh he didn't care about the polling the polling did not say that at all but he used his bully pulpit to frame and change the narrative how do we as Democrats get bolder about actually framing a narrative because I think for a lot of people and I see it even in our district for people that aren't up as up on the issues as you are people look to me and to this office and to us for a frame how do we think about this problem how do we think about the border how do we think about immigration how do we think about health care so we have a real opportunity to use our platforms to really drive a narrative and that in some ways is one of the biggest things that I think Democrats need to need to harness is to be bold and to to understand that our wins did not come from people having incremental positions even in districts that elected swing you know or more more conservative Democrats it was indivisibles that turned out it was black women it was young people it was people who were excited about potentially not even that candidate but maybe a candidate up ticket maybe a Stacey Abrams maybe a Beto O'Rourke and so the analysis has to be right and the analysis has to take us towards the country is moving to common sense slash progressive slash centrist in our meaning of the word proposals transformations in in our economy one other thing we've got to pay attention to monopolies antitrust corporate buybacks I mean if you look at what has happened with inequality when we stopped enforcing the no corporate buyback rules you really saw inequality increase dramatically and instead of money going into wages for workers it went into these stock buybacks and so I think that there there are a few different pieces here that Democrats have been unwilling to take on but we really have to take on antitrust monopoly stuff yeah am I crazy to think that if Democrats or frankly any elected official just did more for their constituents they would need less from their from their donors I mean isn't that the problem with the Democratic Party is it's been so long since we made a big difference in people's lives that they see Democrats as feckless corporate stooges too which is fair right yeah I mean I think that you know I tell everybody who comes in as a new member that constituent services is one of the most important things you can do and and we got back 1.5 million dollars for our constituents we helped over 800 people it was crazy like just having my name in a letter helps people navigate the system but I also think it's it's about it you know we have work to do to really leverage the power of the progressive movement I'm just got elected the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus we have more progressive members than we've ever had before 40% of the caucus are members of the CPC we just set up the CPC see this 501c3 and c4 that can be this intersection between the outside organizing and the inside organizing you saw that work a little bit with the speakers we were able to work with the outside groups to sort of leverage look here are our asks we realized we have very few progressives on most of the exclusive committees that's where the decisions get made ways and means appropriations we were not bad on energy and commerce know hardly anybody financial services one person left you know intelligence one person left so we worked with the progressive groups and said hold your endorsement let us get proportional representation plus a few other things and we will use our power we will leverage our power and we can do that with our donors as well you know we really want to see the Democratic Party move in a way that really addresses this and by the way it's not identity politics versus economics that frame just drives me nuts and so we just have to keep pushing back on that because I think there are a lot of people who are afraid to talk about race a lot of people who think that these are ancillary questions don't get into the immigration questions well you know what it's been put on the table by the president so you know good luck not getting into them so I mean that's all the work we have to do and I am excited about it because I feel like we have this real opportunity to leverage the outside the inside donors you know powerful ideas that are out there and just to seize that narrative well Pramila thank you so much for being with us today super fun to be in your snazzy office Nick thank you for everything you do and for the ideas and for the vision and the passion of the work thank you so it was super fun to get to chat with Pramila in her offices in Washington DC and how awesome is it to have somebody so clear-sighted representing us in Congress yeah we're so lucky here in the seventh to have her and one of the things that she has done so well throughout her career is to take a norm and move it you know that renorming of what a minimum wage should look like renorming of what tipped workers should have access to that's really been one of the things she's been good at and I'm really interested in how she looks at elective office as part of that too often elective officials are running around chasing after polls and not leading and pushing but she really sees her role as an elected person as part of that renorming and and shifting the narrative and I think that part's really interesting exactly and thinking about centrism in this much broader way as it's not centrist unless it directly benefits the broad majority of citizens including the people in the middle you know middle deciles and all the way up into the ninth decile you know that gives permission for people thinking about economic policy to be far bolder than we've ever been before and to just finally acknowledge that what people like Howard Schultz think of a centrism which is just the same ridiculous exploitive policies that make rich people richer and everybody else poor aren't centrist they're just radical trickle-down economics and we need to put them right and it's not like Howard Schultz has shown himself to be a super adept politician is in his rollout and what I really think about the centrist idea is that you get this great intersection of great policy and great politics like it is good for a politician to be on the side of almost everybody right like I don't know how any politician can say that this is not a good idea except for the fact that a lot of politicians are bought and you know purchased by corporations and all that good stuff and it's very threatening right right and so if you have the mechanisms on the outside to organize people you're able to counter that and you're able to I think create the conditions for politicians to do again not just right by everybody but really is in their own self-interest in doing things that are broadly popular that's what is so great about this it's just so perfectly self-interested plus you know the greatness of doing something that benefits a lot of people and you know for our listeners out there I mean as you reflect on these ideas you know we encourage you to think more carefully about what it means to be moderate or centrist and to push back on people who claim the mantle of centrism or moderation because they're simply promoting the same ideas that have made rich people richer and everyone else poorer over the last couple of decades you know these people aren't being moderate they're being Orthodox yeah or they're exactly that's right that's not the same thing they're being extremist only on the side of corporations are the very wealthy is an extremist position that's right and not a centrist position and it's not moderate either even though it may feel like that or seems like that or certainly that they they say that's what they're being these two things have nothing to do with one another speaking of not moderate in our next episode we get to talk to a really remarkable woman who's at the leading edge of monetary policy something called MMT or modern monetary policy dr.
