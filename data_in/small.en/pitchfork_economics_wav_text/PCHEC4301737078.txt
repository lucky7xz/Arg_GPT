 Hey, pitchforks gang, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about another podcast we think you should listen to. It's called Run for Something. It's hosted by political operative Amanda Litman. Amanda is the co-founder and executive director of Run for Something, an organization by the same name as the podcast, which recruits and supports young, diverse progressives running for local office. So tune in every Tuesday to meet some amazing local candidates and newly elected public servants, their parents, teachers, scientists, refugees, artists, veterans, and more. And the one thing they all share is their commitment to solving problems in their communities. Run for Something is a podcast about politics that will make you hopeful for the future. So please check it out. Anisar argues that the Biden administration is making this really profound break with the last 45 years of neoliberalism and that that break is going to create probably the biggest economic boom in collective memory. The only way to stop the political instability which was revealed in 2016 is to restore broad-based growth. Who'd have thought that we'd be talking about Bidenomics? I know. From the home offices of Civic Ventures in downtown Seattle, this is Pitchfork Economics with Nick Hanauer, the best place to get the truth about who gets what and why. I'm Nick Hanauer, founder of Civic Ventures. I'm David Goldstein, senior fellow at Civic Ventures. So Goldie today, we get to talk to a very, very interesting person named Anisar Farooqi. And Anisar is a blogger, remarkably brilliant. I think he's a mathematician turned physicist. He came to my attention because an article that he wrote called The Making of the Mother of All Economic Booms was circulating among some policymakers that I collaborate with. And we thought it'd be really fun to talk to him directly. So in this essay, Anisar argues that the Biden administration is making this really profound break with the last 45 years of neoliberalism and that that break is going to create probably the biggest economic boom in collective memory probably since the 60s. And it will absolutely create the kind of broad-based growth and benefits that should both transform the economy and also potentially the politics, which is an even more important achievement. And kind of runs through how we went wrong and what the assumptions were that led us astray and how the Biden administration and the folks in that world have broken with that and are now on a new path. Yeah, on the path to broad-based growth and as he calls it, the mother of all economic booms. Right. Let's talk to Anisar. My name is Anisar Faruqi. I do research in a whole bunch of subjects. Online, I go on the policy tensor. I used to write policytensor.com, but I've shifted to policytensor.subscrap.com. We have a bunch of other writers and researchers. We'd love for you to take us through the main planks of your argument and analysis. Sure. Your listeners obviously must have heard a lot about the wages of neoliberalism and so the inequality and the slowdown in growth and the kind of patterns that we've seen since the 70s, since the onset of neoliberalism. And what I think has happened, which is the main thesis in that essay, is that we have finally broken through and elites in the United States today and technocrats in particular have come to the conclusion that the only way to stop the political instability, which was revealed in 2016, is to restore broad-based growth. And so the project of restoring broad-based growth requires what Yellen was talking about a couple of days ago, which is we've got to go big on public investment. Public investment has been declining and is really low by historical standards. We must restore it. What is the objective? The objective is to restore broad-based growth. The same thing with the Fed's new commitment to empiricism. The Fed is basically now saying we are not going to hike unless we're not going to remove accommodation, unless we see inflation instead of just predicting it with our models. So much of the piece was about the intellectual revolution within the Fed Democrats and the political elites, driven by this sort of electoral clock of the election in two years and so on. We need to go in big. We need to do something now. We need to show results before we go to the borders again. So that logic has driven a pack, a lot of action into these two years. My question was how did we get here in a larger sense? And the larger sense that I have of how we got here is different from the usual accounts you find, which is blame either technology, so skill bias, technical change is the word that economists use, which is a kind of way of saying there's an exogenous technological shock and we don't have an account of how it happened. But what it did was it increased the wages of highly skilled workers and reduced those of middle skilled workers and hollowed out this economy, but it was this exogenous shock or this globalization idea that foreign is responsible, German competition, Japanese competition, Taiwanese, Korean and Chinese, ultimately China becomes the big boogeyman. So China is responsible, this China shock is responsible for the destabilization of US manufacturing, for the decline of productivity growth in US manufacturing, for the decline of good, well-paying manual skill jobs. That story doesn't add up. And I think what is really going on, instead of these two objects, you have a different kind of logic operating. And I think of these as the logics of discipline. So what you have is the crisis, the second is the actation crisis destroys belief in the ability of politicians to manage the macro economy. So they are told to stand aside and new institutions are built in order to constrain their action. So the Europeans go well beyond anything that the young is actually going to achieve on this. But what is happening everywhere is the same. The treasury and the finance ministers are empowered to control the spending ministries. The bond markets are brought into discipline, sovereign borrowing and spending and budget decisions and so on. And a series of institutions are created to discipline governments, financially discipline governments, largely to work out the bond market. And this comes together with that famous quote from Carmine who tells Clinton, I want to be, when I die, I want to be born again as not as a baseball hitter, but as a bond market, you can intimidate anybody. That logic of disciplines comes together with the rise of finance and with the whole new economy. And this extends very deep. It extends into industry. So all the firms to the great industrial firms, which are responsible for the mid century productivity growth, which are responsible for the growth of the American working class and the achievement of middle class standards, that was the envy of the world. That whole thing was tied at the hip to the productivity and dynamism of these industrial firms, which were brought under the discipline of finance to buy out firms, the barbarians of the gate story, the buy out firms, the private equity firms went in and really created a market for corporate control. And they discipline these firms and made them these gorgeous services to finance and to essentially move away from a long term investment and investment in long term productivity growth and towards the short term model where, you know, shenanigans, financial shenanigans, you borrow money from the, from the bond market and then you do some buybacks or something. And that, that massage is the, you know, the returns on the stock, which is very good. But basically, yeah, that the primacy of shareholder value maximization as a, as a business ethic and modality of operation, right? The dominance of that. Yeah. Sure. Right. Right. But what I'm saying is that these firms themselves became very became targets. So the relationship between finance and industry completely reversed where, you know, bankers had waited on the, on the, on the industrial firms, CEOs, it was now the CEOs who were reporting every quarter to the financial analysts. And this relationship of power between Wall Street and industries is crucial to why dynamism vanished from the manufacturing sector. This is at least part of the story. The other two other parts of the story. So I talked about this monetary discipline. I talked about the discipline of, of governments and the discipline of the firm, the discipline, the force of displaying these firms and governments and economies. And the bottom of the monetary system is crucial because what happened with the feds and the other hard term, seashoring center banks is that once they were committed to price stability at all costs, and they started hiking and anticipation of inflation that introduced a very strong deflationary bias in the system, kind of like what happened in the gold standard, right? Yeah. A strong deflationary bias and the whole world economy was introduced by the reaction function of the Fed and the ECB. And the Bank of Japan was the first to get through actually from, from this rigidity of the mind, right? All of these processes are unfolding and this is leading to a decline in middle skilled jobs. And so the hourglass economy obtains in the nineties and income growth stalls for the bulk of the population. And the sheer number of jobs disappear for high school graduates, right? And this is devastating for working class families, which, you know, the divorce rates keep going up even when the middle class divorce rates stabilize that child out of wedlock rates keep going up, even after the middle class child out of wedlock rates stabilize from the nineties, mid nineties onwards, and they just keep declining. And so working class families are devastated. And this starts showing up in deaths of despair, beginning at the turn of the century, right? And that is a huge story because deaths of despair is the single best predictor of the swing towards Trump in 2016. It's really the pain of a working class America that leads to that reward. And this is not really properly understood people think it's racial resentment and so on, so on. Those are, those are secondary logics. That's not, that's not what's driving the anger in the first place. So as I read your essay, I was super impressed by the analysis and it is consonant with our own analysis, but it's not the same. And, you know, a big part of our analysis is that the world and particularly the left, which is where the problem lies, bought the neoclassical neoliberal framing of economic cause and effect. And the simplest way to explain it is the pervasive view that there is this mechanical relationship between wages and the number of jobs. And if wages are pushed up, then the number of jobs will go down, you know, because the economy is this parade of optimal equilibrium within which if one thing goes up, another thing has to go down. And that, and that view was totally pervasive on the progressive left, even among left leaning economists, which is sort of the fuel for the neoliberal fire, right? It's the summer's Olivier Blanchard view of inflation. It goes on and on, right? That anything that happens to wealthy people is an unalloyed good, right? The size of the bonus pool at Goldman Sachs is by definition a good thing. That's fine. But God forbid, we send some unemployment insurance to working people that will that will kill jobs or harm incentives or whatever it is. And so that one of the things that I found so interesting about your analysis, which is I think dead on is how you connect neoclassical economic theory and the weaponized version of that, which is neoliberalism with these sort of macroeconomic policies and behaviors. I think that the connection is at the side of the hip. And here's how I think about this. It's not so much that you have these New Keynesian BGSE models that the technocrats really buy. This is what the economy looks like, right? It's not just that technical understanding of the economy that is at stake. What is at stake is the model economy, right? So you are convinced what you really deep down convinced about all of them, some summers, Blanchard, the whole works, what that and even yell at until this year, what you're really surely what you were really truly convinced about is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Right? Yes. They trade off. Right. So if you want to, if you're going to have deficits by me, it's going to create some problem. Maybe it's not inflation. Maybe it'll be a currency. Maybe it will be run on the dollar. Then everything goes down. You're going to have to pay. Right. And this is a question that is really tied very closely to the kind of moral commitments of these. Yes. Right. And all right. Post one talk in general. Right. That's right. Exactly. If it because if it is a Pareto optimal equilibrium system, that has to be the case. It's a closed system. Exactly. It has to be true. The problem of course is it's not that kind of fucking system. That's not how it works. It's not how it works. It's an open, complex, adaptive ecology with energy pouring into it. Exactly. From the outside of your cake and eat it too. I completely agree. This notion that you can understand it like a closed system, you know, puppet five equations. And then that works just, you know, it just doesn't hold any water. Not after we know what, what kind of openness and extraction that is constantly necessary. You need to constantly extract a larger and larger portion of the world's resources to keep this humming. And you need to dump larger and larger amounts of carbon and other garbage into the system. And so it's not a, it's not a closed system. It's an open system. It wouldn't survive with the system. That's one thing. The other thing is that very more particularly, just going back to that, that idea of not having your cake and eat it too, right? It's coupled to this idea that something is going to go wrong if we have deficits and these things are baked into people's minds from the seventies. Right. So what took the big fear is macroeconomic instability of some kind. And this is the main constraint on action, right? So the main constraint on climate action, the main constraint on action on restoring broad based roads is this intellectual rigidity, which says that there are definite limits beyond which you can't push the economy or you can't push public finance. So the question of fiscal responsibility and the question of a potential responsibility, I think is crucial. Like unless we know how to talk about this in a more informed way, in a more empirically grounded way and away from those, you know, kind of theoretical ways of thinking about this in a five equation framework or something, unless we can move away from that theoretical moral commitment and talk about it in a more realistic way. What is the concern? The concern of US borrowing is what bond market participants will accept. And as the main provider of safe assets in the system, that constraint is completely slack. Right. The Fed can put an arbitrary amount of money. That constraint is completely slack. Right. Like the only constraint on the Fed is inflation itself. Right. And then you must talk about the process of inflation and what does that do to inflation. And what has happened to inflation is globalized. You need to make these intellectual moves. But before you get to a place where you can be freed from the old rigidities that prevent a decisive action on the main challenges of the day. So I'm curious. I mean, you're, and we'll get to this in a moment. You're talking about how this change we're going through now was the making of the mother of all economic booms. Are you implying we could have had an economic boom all along over the past 45. So none, none of the dislocation, none of the inequality, none of the slow growth was necessary or unavoidable. Had we not had this swing towards neoliberalism? I'm absolutely certain of that. The reason is that we could have, for example, we could, the Fed could have always run the economy really hot, which is what they now plan to do. Right. They could have always on the economy really hot. What that would have meant was that low skilled workers wages, middle skilled workers wages, people with high school degrees, their wages would have grown at the same rate as college graduates salaries and professional class salaries, which have exploded. Right. And so this is why I'm saying that it's a very systematic pattern of the behavior of the major institutions of management. That is the real conditioner. That is what created the secular downside. Right. And once you, once you destroy them or once you dismantle these, these institutions, these utilities, then you immediately are free. Right. You know, the way the way British economy started booming immediately right out of the window of gold and then 31. Right. They bled themselves into going back to gold in 1925 at pre-war power of four eighty six dollars a pound. Right. And they did this bloodletting and they forced themselves to go back at pre-war power. And then they suffered this massive recession through the 20s. And then they went off, got into the one and everything was fine. Right. Right. That's what's that. I think that's the real model. So, you know, Nick and I are old enough to remember the 1970s and the gas lines and the inflation, the stagflation. Paul Volcker gets credit for crushing inflation. I know when I was in my student loans in college were like 12, 15 percent, because those are what interest rates were in the early 80s. But he gets a lot of credit for driving up interest rates and crushing inflation and creating all that hardship. Could we have gotten inflation under control another way? I don't think so. No, the precondition. I agree with Paul on this. So the chair, the Federal Reserve chair in his last speech, which is what prompted myself, he said that the key to the whole thing, the key to the whole thing is inflation expectations are completely anchored on target. Right. They are not going to move. They're going to set up plus epsilon. Right. And that is the precondition on this inflation expectations are anchored on target. You're playing with fire because anything could destabilize. Right. If they move all over the place, then you really risk a spiral of inflation. And that's what happened in the 70s. Right. Inflation expectations were de-anchored in the mid 70s. And by the late 70s, they were completely out of control and completely destabilized the whole macro economy, the management of the macro economy. So they had to be brought down. And I think Walker did the right thing, actually. And Carter was forced to appoint him because of the fall in the dollar. The dollar fell like 20, 30 percent and very rapidly. And he was panicked into appointing the known inflation hawk to go and fix it. Then Walker takes over, which is why I call this the Walter Cool. Right. I'm following Dumian and Levy, called it the 1979 cool. But it was necessary. But what happens after you had stabilized inflation expectations? Inflation expectations were completely stabilized by the early 90s, mid 90s. Right. And what happens after that is that you stay with this old rigidity that you need to keep hiking in anticipation of inflation when your models predict that there will be inflation a year down from now, which is, you know, the multi-palsy works with a lag. That is the key when, you know, you know, they're going to screw this up again. When they say multi-palsy works with a lag. Right. It means that they are not looking at the data. They're using the model predictions to design policy. And that's a that's been a capacity for the past 20 years. Among my group of advocates for reform, one of the things that we're all speaking about is how surprised we are by the quality of the execution of the Biden administration. So far, like it's just actually shocking the degree to which they have married the right narratives with the right policies. It is very pleasantly shocking. I must confess. Just everybody's like, what the hell? And the feebleness of the opposition. Yeah. Ideologically, the other side is just surrendered all of a sudden. The GOP is having an existential crisis. They are not available for the conversation. I will say that the Biden administration is making a catastrophic mistake on climate. They seem to be unconvinced that a decisive action is necessary on that front. And that is very dangerous because we don't have much time. But, you know, my friends who were in the climate space are pretty satisfied. They wish it was more, of course, with the embedded climate action in the infrastructure bill. They feel pretty strongly like these are huge steps. I would say that is greenwashing. It's not nearly enough. The scale of the transformation required for this is an auto magnitude larger than what's already contained in the infrastructure bill and the other bill being considered by the White House. The scale of investment that they have in mind is kind of around what Warren had in mind, like $200 billion a year. It's going to be at least a two-minute year. And the reason is that you need to change your entire supply chains. You need to change how the energy infrastructure works. A million of the millions of jobs have to be created to truly energy transition. And it's not just going to happen with a couple of hundred billion dollars. I think that the Biden administration is very, very shrewdly positioning the entire infrastructure bill, which does include a lot of things for climate change and other priorities for people as a jobs bill, because that's how you will generate the public support to push it over the line. And the simple truth is that despite the existential threat of climate change to the planet and the country, the majority of citizens in our country do not agree with you and have shown, again and again, that they are not willing to support policies that involve near-term economic trade-offs for long-term benefits because we have spent the last 45 years savaging their economic well-being. So this is the great conundrum, is you have created a citizenry that is so economically fragile that any kind of trade-off you ask them to make is sort of beyond their capacity, which is very challenging if you're trying to do the right thing for the long-term. I'm not so sure about this. The reason I'm not so sure about this is because I don't buy this trade-off. There's no short-term, long-term trade-off. The energy transition will require running the economy hot for 10 years. It will require a large scale of public and private investment. And I think that there are better ways of financing it. And I've written about it with Albert Pinto, how to finance a Green New Deal. But this idea that it's going to hurt the working class, so they'll have to pay in the short term, it's just not possible. That's not what anybody's proposing. I agree with you that in the aggregate, there's no trade-off, but there are certainly winners and losers. It complicates the politics of this. I completely agree that the political economy is the challenge, right? And that's the main challenge. The main challenge is the political economy. So one way of doing this is to have a coalition of very powerful friends. And I think that is what is happening with the Biden White House, the Harris people and the Biden people. They have the backing of Silicon Valley. They have the backing of Wall Street. And that's how you contain the personal interest. If you want to have a real green transition, you need some really, really powerful people on K Street on your side. And I agree with that way of thinking about this. And a political economy solution has to be found. The question is, what does that look like? Specific interest type to, let's say fracking in Pennsylvania may not be all solvable in detail, but a political coalition can be assembled. I'm talking about money. I'm not talking about people. I'm talking about people and money. A political coalition of voters and of moneyed interests can be assembled, which can back the energy transition, the politics of the energy transition. And so what I'm trying to say is this. Look, you created this new party system in 1930s. And this new party system in the 1930s was based on the hegemony of the Democratic Party. And this party system oversaw large scale transformation. And the GOP kind of adapted to that world. And they began to adopt the rhetoric and the ideas of the Democratic Party and became part of that system. Something similar has to be obtained now, which is that a new party system has to emerge based on the hegemony of the Democratic Party. But this can't happen unless you've solved the, unless you make some progress in solving the problem of past confrontation, the problem of, I think that's the most serious challenge. The serious challenge is to restore elite mass relations somehow enough so that you can get backing for the next step. You need buy. You need buy. So let's talk about what might get us that buy in. And that is getting back to the title of your essay, The Mother of All Economic Booms. How big? What are we looking at? So the Fed's saying 6.5%, Goldman's saying 8%. I think Goldman's closer to the market, maybe even slightly more. That's just 2021. They can really sustain very high rates of growth for the next 24 months before the election. I mean, this is almost kind of over determined at this point. We're going to have a very large economic boom. People are just going to come out and they're just going to let their hair down after the pandemic, lockdowns and so on. There's a lot of pent up demand. What is really the main, the crucial key to the boom is that the Fed is ready to accommodate it. The Fed is ready to wait and see for inflation. And that's the crucial key condition without which this doesn't work. And so now you have massive public spending. You have the spent up demand and you have the Fed ready to be accommodative for as long as it takes. That is the recipe for really the best economic boom since the late sixties. And it'll be broad based. I mean, we had just before the pandemic hit, we had just started to see wages recover, wages growing. At the low end, I don't know how much of that were the minimum wage hikes that were passed in States around the country and how much of that was the market, but low wage workers, they should expect to benefit from this boom too. Absolutely. So what we saw in the past 10 years is that as the labor market began to tighten, the beach was accelerated for low income workers. And it started matching the salaries of the professional class, the growth rate of the salary refreshments class. And that period of 2016, 2017 to 2020, 2019, that period saw an actual real genuine wage growth for the mass of the population. This is a lesson that has been really learned by the macro economists and Fed Democrats and so on. And what they've learned is that labor market's tight doesn't mean inflation because the Phillips curve is dead, but labor market's tight means wage increases for everybody because the wage curve is alive and key. That's the key. So that's how you can have a K-C-D-D. Right. No, absolutely. You say the Phillips curve is dead. Was it ever real or was it just like something that matched a couple decades of economic data and looked like it was real? No, it was real. It was real. I mean, it was real in the sense that before you had this kind of unbundling of production outside the borders of the big autarket, it's the largest economy in the world. And it's kind of relatively, you can think of it as a closed economy in a way that you cannot think of Germany or even Japan. So what was happening at mid century for these decades is that there was a genuine trade off between inflation and unemployment and that the Fed had learned to manage. And that was the idea that they had gotten into their heads in the 70s and 60s, in the 70s and 80s. But the thing is that Phillips curve relationship, which was really truly existing for decades, increasingly broke down because of what happened to the supply chains of these firms. So now these supply chains are spread out over Canada and Mexico and some run into China, some can go into Southeast Asia and this entire global production system, we saw perfect illustration of this when that ship turned in the Suez Canal, right? There were hundreds of these ships, getting billions, hundreds of billions of stuff in mostly intermediate components across the world to keep the value chains running. And these value chains have very large excess capacity. And that is why inflation is really dead. Once you start running, the economy really hot and the whole world economy, the US pulls the whole world economy out of recession in 2021 and 2022. Then you're going to start seeing some tightening in these global supply chains. And then maybe a couple of few years down the line, we might start to see inflation again, right? So it's not disappeared. That's right. But there's another couple of things that have changed the relationship between unemployment and inflation over the last 40 or 50 years. One of them is that it has just become at least an order of magnitude easier in all sorts of ways to generate more capacity in whatever industry you're in, right? It used to take years to set up a factory. You can do it in months today. Yeah, you can get it right. Like so easy. Oh my God. You know, like it's just so much easier to generate capacity. And the other thing, of course, as Goldie was pointing out earlier, is that there are so many goods and services that are made not out of atoms, but out of bits. Right. Where your capacity is infinite. You don't have no cost investments yet. Zero. You just buy a little bit more space on AWS and on Amazon servers. And there you go. It's in spin up a few more drives and that's it. So, Anasar, let's conclude with this question. Aside from the climate change point that I think you wisely made, what other advice would you have for the Biden administration? I think the Biden administration needs to figure out how to talk about anti-racism with the white working class. And I think this is a challenge for progressives as a whole and for the Democratic Party and the left of the Democratic Party as a whole, which is they don't know how to talk about it. Right now, the way they talk about it does a lot of class work and people hate it. People really hate it. And it's become this currency of status competition, which is very unfortunate because it is a necessary revolution in that. The key thing right now, what they're doing is they're keeping a lid on it. They don't want to talk about it. Which is fine for the temporary, for the first phase of the operation. But it is not a long term solution. In the long term, you need to figure out how to repair relations with the white working class, which has now become the Republican Party. And that would help, even if you can't win them back really, that would have changed the tone of the GOP. That would change the norms by which the GOP elites mobilize their voters. And that conversation has to be won and it would not be won by scolding from the pages of the New York Times. That's right. But what it will be won by is actually delivering the economic goods to middle class people. Yes. For the first time in 40 years. Absolutely. It won't get them all, but it will get some of them. And proving again to people that government can be a force for good, that policy can make a difference, positive difference in people's lives. And a political party can be on the side of ordinary people, not just rich shitbags like myself. And what do you recommend for neoliberals? What should they do in response to this crisis of faith they must be having right now? Is it over? Are they done? Should they just surrender? I don't know what they, I mean, they should change their minds in light of new information, but I don't know what they will do. I suppose, you know, I really enjoyed watching Summers rant and rave. It felt so fun. It would be like, you know, just foreign policy change and Kissinger would rant and rave on like, you know, Tucker Carlson tonight. Like that. Yeah. That it was that kind of moment. I really savored it. Short and Friday. Yeah. I know. I agree. I agree. I don't think Larry Summers cares at all about inflation. He cares about relevance. Yeah. Well, listen, Anisar, thank you so much for being with us. We haven't asked the final question. Okay. Let's ask the final question. Okay. We asked this of everybody. Why do you do this work? I don't know how not to. That's a good, that's a good answer. But you know what? Yeah. I was a blogger for a number of years and yeah, it was, I was nuts that, yeah, I couldn't not do it. I understand that totally. That's great. But in any case, as you develop ideas, we'll be watching. But if you think that there are important things that folks are missing or need to be highlighted, we look forward to hearing more from you about that. So again, thank you so much for being with us. It's really, really fun. A pleasure. Fun chat. Okay. We'll talk soon. Bye bye. Who'd have thought, Nick, Bidenomics, that we'd be talking about Bidenomics. I mean, I got to admit, I was a Warren Democrat. Elizabeth Warren was my first choice. My second choice was Bernie Sanders, right? Biden as the means towards a new deal. Yeah. Who'd have thought, Nick? I know, I know. And you know, people are frankly astounded by how well these folks are executing and how little there is to criticize in the approach that they have taken so far. Because for sure, you know, my experience and sort of my political career has been largely intense frustration with the folks that theoretically are on my side. And the Biden people are just crushing it. I definitely was not disappointed in our conversation with Anisar. He's clearly just a brilliant guy and a deep thinker and a great researcher. And I hope that we'll get to hear a lot more from him about macroeconomics and policy. And also looking forward to him being right about his projections of 8% growth with no inflation. That's right. Yeah. His recent article is in the show notes. We highly recommend folks read it and subscribe to his sub stack. I think you'll find an astonishing array of writing there across really interesting subjects. And you know, he's just a really interesting guy and we're following. And in the next episode of Pitchfork Economics, we get to talk to my friend, Mariana Mazzucato, one of the world's foremost economists on a mission based economy.
