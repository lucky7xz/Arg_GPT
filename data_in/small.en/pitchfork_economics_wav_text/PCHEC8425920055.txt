 Hey Pitchfork economics listeners. Today we had planned to release a really fascinating episode of Backpack Scenes, Market Incentives, and the Pharmaceutical Industry, but in light of the events of last week, it didn't feel right to release that episode today. So instead, we're going to join many other podcasts participating in a podcast blackout and play 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence to honor George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and pay tribute to the many other victims of racial violence. And in the show notes, we'll link to organizations that are doing the anti-racist work to reform our power structures in this country, from law enforcement to our economy to the way we write and enforce our policies, orgs that could use your help and attention. These are experts and advocates, and I'll be seeking them out and listening to them, and I hope you'll do the same. We'll see you next week. Thanks for listening.
