 Hi, it's Paul. I just want to let you know that we recorded this episode before the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States, so in this episode we don't mention coronavirus or COVID-19 even once. We thought that might be nice for a change, so we are releasing this episode this week. Given that Verizon says that video game use has increased by 75% during the shutdown, it seems like a good time to think about how video games are made and what that labor looks like. Enjoy and have a great weekend. Hey, I'm Stephen Palilini. I'm the program director for Civic Action, which is the online digital advocacy platform for Civic Ventures. And I'm Paul Constan. I'm a writer at Civic Ventures. Today's episode is about economics in the gaming industry, and I am personally super stoked to talk about this because I am an avid gamer and I just love this conversation. Actually, before I got into politics, I played video games semi-professionally in high school and college and thought sort of very strongly about going into that actually as a career. I am not a gamer. I played a Mario many years ago and I like a Pac-Man. I've always been interested in the gaming industry because it is such a huge part of the lives of people. I was going to say young people, but really everyone, people who are my age, people who are younger like Stephen, and it's just like this fascinating alternative entertainment industry that I'm aware of but I don't participate in. So I have kind of a unique perspective on it, but I'm really excited by how excited Stephen is by it. And this episode is super interesting to me because I write comic books in my spare time and as an interviewer I talk with a lot of writers about things like compensation and a lot of people don't think about the money behind the industries that they enjoy. And Paul, actually one of the reasons you should care, even though you don't play video games a lot, is this is a massive industry. Last year's revenues were $134.9 billion. And in contrast to most entertainment industries that are like that, there's actually very weak labor standards and almost no unionization at all. There are over 220,000 employees just in the United States alone and 15% of them, a full 15% of them are actually contract workers. The gaming industry at large is actually this kind of trickle downer's paradise. There are rampant abuses of overtime, wage suppression, constant harassment and discrimination and toxic environment claims, and abuse of misclassification of workers as contractors. I think one of the reasons that's the case is that the trajectory of the gaming industry growing up from infancy into this massive multi-billion dollar industry happened right along at the same time as this era of neoliberalism and deregulation of our economy. And so it is rising up at the same time as the trickle down narrative of wage suppression, tax cuts and deregulation is taking hold. So for such a lucrative industry tied as it is with other entertainment industries that have unionization and good pay, the question is why does gaming have so few labor regulations that other sort of interrelated industries do? I think the answer to that is as an industry gaming has sort of grown up in the era of neoliberalism where new regulations or more stringent regulations and standards are frowned upon by industry because they're seen as getting in the way of profits and growth. Of course that's not the way that it works, but there's kind of a libertarian Silicon Valley sort of vibe in the gaming industry that you don't see with movies which have been unionized since the 30s and 40s I believe. Yeah I think the contrast here that's really interesting is there are sort of two paths and gaming as an industry is sort of relatively new. It's sort of still in its adolescence. And it can go the path of the film industry and investing in the human and labor capital that makes movies such great products. And it can then become sort of like the film industry, one of the most dominant and reliably consistent profitable industries on the planet. Or it can go the way of deregulation and trickle down economics and become like the pre-2008 housing industry. And I think that's where we're at in this moment and I'm so stoked to have the conversation with folks that are both in the industry and on the forefront of leading the unionizing efforts for that reason. And just personally as somebody who has consumed video games their entire life and as somebody who cares deeply about these products I also have to reckon with myself, do I care about how they're made? And do I care about the people who put their blood, sweat and tears into making the things that have become such a huge part of my identity? And one of those people is our guest Jennifer Hale. She is the most prolific voice actor of all time in the gaming industry and a personal hero of mine who has over 407 just acting credits on IMDB. So I am so stoked to talk to her. This is Jennifer Hale, Master of the Universe. Nice to be here. I am a massive fan of yours. I've been playing video games my entire life. And I was looking over your filmography and getting ready for this podcast recording and it was like a trip down my childhood. I mean every one of these awesome games and these awesome characters I grew up with you are the voice actor behind. The first one for me was back in 2007 you were Bastila in Knights of the Old Republic which is to this day one of my favorite games of all time. So I have to get that out of the way because you are like a hero to me. Oh my God, well I'm so grateful that you like the work. Thank you so much. Well, I'm a fan of what you guys do. Huge fan of what you guys are doing. Thanks so much. I read Nick's article, the pitch works are coming. I think it was August 2014 sometime around then. Whenever it came out and I was like yes! What he said! Exactly! Oh my gosh that's awesome. So let's start here which is that video games as an industry has been exploding over the last 10 years but most people sort of consuming it or even sort of tangentially consuming it don't really understand the process of how it gets made. So could you just sort of describe like what's your role in making the game? What's that day to day like? I was going to say I can speak to that because I can tell you that the people I work for are exhausted and work a bazillion hours and are unbelievable in what they can pull off. My piece of the equation takes place both in games and then far away on the sidelines. You know to get ready to do what we do. Voice actors spend an enormous amount of time learning and training and there's all kinds of levels to learn like you've got to be an actor first. You've got to know how to do that in a way that's engaging and will engage people on a kind of you know a cellular level if you will. And so you're training yourself as an actor. You're also marketing yourself as an actor and doing all that stuff just to get to the point where you could get the job. And say you get called first thing you get called is you get the audition and you're sent sides which is what we call them and you frequently used to be you'd go into the agent's office and you'd get directed by a booth director or you'd get called to a casting director's office and someone would give you some context and they'd kind of help you understand the bigger picture. Nowadays you get emailed the script to your inbox and you record at home much of the time on your own and you send it in pretty blind. So that's the first step is just just getting that accomplished and then you get cast and you you show up on the day and you walk in and it's it's cold reading. But a lot of the time we don't even know what the job actually is. They call it you know Project Pineapple you know Project Peanut you know whatever they'll just have a name and code name for it and you could be in the next installment of the biggest grossing game of all time but you don't know that. And up until recently your agents didn't know that either for negotiating purposes. So you go into the job and when you're really lucky the writers there with the director and noise director and anybody else from the team producers maybe and they'll give you a wonderful takedown on the story arc. So you kind of get a sense of what's happening and then you start recording but much of the time you're recording out of sequence you're like oh okay you know you're recording the part where you just punch them out but you haven't even met them yet. What I'm trying to understand I guess is the differences in the industries and you know film is an industry where everyone from you know the voice actor to the screenwriter to the director and the producer and the lighting you know folks are all unionized and are all heavily involved in the project and and video games you're probably one of the only people involved in the making of the games on most of these projects that's unionized. And I just want to try to understand the conditions and sort of what it's like to the extent that you can talk a little bit about that. Yeah there are people out there who are very much on the ground floor of this process and I will say this fight to make the playing field a healthier better place to exist. They know a lot more than I do about this but I will speak to what I do know which is you know it's a national industry and anytime you've got something new going on it's the Wild West and that's exciting and it's fun and it's crazy and it's insane and I've done sessions that were supposed to be four that ended up being nine and a half hours you know way back in the beginning we just kept going and then people didn't realize they had to pay for that and we had to sort of fight for that and it was communicated but it wasn't really heard you know and I'm lucky that way but anytime you've got a baby industry like this to me it brings out all forms of I'll call it human nature it's corporate nature you've got those corporate spirits that are saying hey this is great we need to everybody help make this happen let's take care of everybody so we can keep going further farther better and then you've got those spirits going mine I started this thing so it's mine you know you've got basically the sustainable versus the unsustainable model and right now I think there's a battle in the gaming industry for which which heart is going to win the sustainable one or the unsustainable one right now there's a lot of the industry eating its young there's a lot of the industry burning people up because they don't let them eat they reward this self sacrificing behavior which initially comes from enthusiasm it comes from like I love this I just don't want to leave and then it becomes you're punished if you leave you're punished if you take care of your basic human needs and because everybody's basic human needs are a little different and people want to belong right so they don't want to fly in the face of that and look bad so they sacrifice themselves and kill themselves and burn themselves out and the industry is losing incredible talent it's losing its depth you know it in terms of its players you know on the field they're losing depth because they're sacrificing them you'd never do that to a sports team and acting in the beginning we actors if it weren't for those actors that took that stand in the early 20th century to unionize I couldn't do this for a living and I have definitely seen a downward pressure on wages and what's getting negotiated for us as actors and we're not we're not walking a cakewalk because you know it looks like we get paid a lot of money for a little time but when we're paid we're paid not just for the time we're there in that booth or there on that set we're being also paid for the hours and hours and hours that we put into stay competitive to keep our skills up the theater we do for free the classes we pay for and take the training we do to stay dialed up like an athlete in the offseason that's what we're required to do to stay competitive and if you don't you're not competitive the other thing that we're selling is our exposure you can be the lead in a game only so many times and then you got to go on the shelf for a while I remember it was early 2000s and I've been in this business long enough to know that sometimes you're in fashion sometimes you're out of fashion you can't take either personally and I happen to be in fashion in the commercial world I literally could not turn on a TV or radio at the time without hearing a commercial within a few minutes that I was on it was bananas I was like wow this is crazy but I knew enough to know I need to save my money I said it out loud I said I'm gonna be on the shelf for I don't know six six and a half years and I was on the shelf for about six six and a half years like that's how it rolls and so when you're the lead in a bunch of games you better save your money because they're gonna want a so-and-so type someone like you not you because that's too much associated with all that other stuff so you have to you have to have enough money to save to go on the shelf and then go reinvent yourself as something else as the villains or the character people or just wait it out that's part of what that compensation is for and the devs when they're in there I mean I I don't hesitate to even speak about it because I don't have the authority and I believe not the right because it's not my part of the circle right but from the outside what I see is an enormous amount of talent that if they're going to jump in and burn themselves out for you please compensate them in such a way that they can take a breather gather themselves and come back and be in there for you again bringing all those years of expertise and all that stuff that ultimately saves you money like when I walk in a booth you put me in there against somebody who's done it for a couple years I'm going to save you time and money just because it's what I bring I bring 37 38 years of being in the booth into that booth and all my time as a human being and all my fascination with and time in the trenches as an actor and how I care about that and I've examined it and played with it and been exposed to it and learned from my peers who are the most brilliant people on the planet I would be nothing had I not been exposed to the peers that I work with I wouldn't know a dang thing without them there's just watching them as like a masterclass every single time but without putting in that time I'm saving people money in that booth on that stage just because I bring all that to the party and the devs they have that it's heartbreaking to see that jeopardized in that way. One of the things that really frustrates me when I talk about unionization because I come from journalism and so I've been following a lot of newsrooms have been unionizing lately and some very high profile newsrooms that are probably they're pretty well compensated and a lot of people think that unionization is just about money and you made a great case for for why money is important and you know everybody thinks because you're an actor you're you know lounging poolside right now in Beverly Hills and I don't know those people where are they so so there is an economic case to be made but I there's there's more to it than that you know I think one of the first arguments I hear when people talk about the gaming industry is oh they're they're really well paid so the churn and burn thing is is accounted for in their high paychecks and is there anything you can say maybe not specifically because you explain why you can't talk directly for the devs but why why it's not just about a paycheck a number on a paycheck well I always go to the meta honestly for me it's about the society in the world you want to live in unions exist because greed exists as long as there is greed we have to have a balancing element and granted unions can become greedy anything can become greedy and corrupt but right now this country this world society the greatest ill we have is not it's not devices ness devices ness is a symptom to me the greatest ill we have the greatest problem we have is not unions versus not unions or have versus it's greed it's corporate co-reading corruption and you got a very few people gathering a lot of the wealth at the top and until we can change the part of human nature that makes that not happen anymore we need protections and unions are protections do we want to live in a world where we take care of each other or will we cut each other's throats one other aspect to this that I think about sometimes too is right you know if you don't have the union protections as a member of the screenwriters and actors guild then I don't get Jennifer Hale and commander Shepard or or as samus or as basila or in all of these awesome you know characters that I've grown up with and you know have been a huge part of my life I don't get that product as a consumer too and so unionization actually not just being about pay or even work conditions it's actually about making a better product making something that the consumers want what that brings to mind for me is art is about the elevation of our souls and ourselves we find inspiration there we find things that we lift us up in that way we can't quantify and the quantified life is not the only life I mean that's this whole thing about the 1980s and you know the numbers the numbers I mean this BS that we live in I'm gonna have to start for a second it makes me bananas and this is probably the only podcast it will really be you guys will get it what the hell is this metric about the measure of the stock market is the measure of the health of a society with that and that same dismissiveness ties into I think what you were just saying which is we need this art we need our souls elevated and and you can't unions and things like that protect and create a structure within which that can happen with less far less abuse I mean there's god there's also safety issues I mean I was on a mocap set yesterday and hearing horror stories about you know a set where because you have non unions stuff going on there you got people's lives in danger you know people's career permanent injuries and things like that going on could you talk about why do you do this work what what is it about the work that that really appeals to you I love it I oh my god I'm getting all choked up these people I work with these stories we get to tell these moments we get to have like I get to immerse myself in being somebody who actually saved the universe depending on which ending you picked I don't like I wanted to do that since I was four and I actually get to do it it's pretend but I don't care I get to do it you know I get to disappear into another human being for a few hours and I don't exist and that is the greatest gift in the world I get to take these stories of these writers who are just ah they're just such gifts and hopefully bring them to life in a way that that writer envisioned and if we're lucky we get to happen upon something more I get to surrender to the flow and the muse and disappear myself into something so much bigger than me thank you for for being so generous with your time and and your experiences we really appreciate it thank you for having me I'm such a fan of what you're doing I really really appreciate you guys thank you so much for coming on this is so cool you've totally made it here I think you have been way here it's actually totally true anytime I'm here take care thanks you guys bye so here's somebody with personal experience in the gaming industry as an independent game developer who asked not to be identified because they are also on the front lines of the unionization efforts as an organizer for game workers unite so my role in game making is as a programmer I spend most of my time working with designers they'll say we want the game to work like this I'll write out the code to actually make it work like that but a lot of my day to day is back and forth with designers and artists trying to collaborate on getting the game into a good state so I'm rarely working on my own game companies can range in size from a single person to hundreds or maybe even over a thousand people something that makes games really hard to kind of plan out normally the first thing that most people think about the game industry the first thing I always hear is oh so you get to play games all day and as fun as that would be that's unfortunately not the chase I mean everybody's very excited about what they're doing we all feel very lucky to be there but that passion isn't endless you know at the end of the day it's a job and while we are working on video games and that is really cool it's still our well nine to five charitably but more often than not not nine to five and a lot of times people are working on projects because they're really excited about it but those lines start to blur when you've got tons of people on a project and you're working on tight deadlines and then I mean maybe people are choosing to work longer on projects but there could be a lot of other pressures involved in that so that passion isn't endless something that makes that difficult is I forget why I heard this but I once heard game development described as making a movie while you're building the camera and that it's a very chaotic process organization and structuring is kind of one of our weakest points so there are a lot of studios making big strides in that area so the game industry has never been too great on working conditions it started out as this kind of romanticized idea of like kids and their parents garages coding stuff out it didn't really have a very industrial feel to it so that working habit of if we misjudged how long this feature is going to take to make we can just sleep in the office you know work nights and weekends but as that adopted into a corporate culture we never really fixed that problem we never really established regular working hours so there's always been a problem but more recently a lot more of that stuff has been coming to light reporting teams like the ones at Kotaku have been doing really in-depth pieces exposing how bad some of the hours and working conditions are and those are really big like when those big articles come out everybody's talking about that around the office and that's been really huge just for increasing awareness and increasing the conversation but it's also made the public more aware of it and that's made people more comfortable talking about these openly you know it was always kind of an open secret but now it's it's not even a secret anymore like you can read about this in the New York Times so now that everybody's talking about it and these conditions are out in the open and people are discussing it we have more of a chance to make the big strides towards unionizing unionizing or at the very least improving labor standards I think is very necessary for the continued health of the industry because people are burning out left and right it's very rare for people to stay in the industry more than 10 years and that means that we don't have a lot of like really experienced people in the industry and that means like people keep making rookie mistakes burnout makes people worse at their job you know when I've been working an 80 hour week and you know I'm not going to be at my sole capacity anymore I'm not I'll be making silly mistakes and I think that overall this does make the workplace but also the products we made worse so there are a lot of things keeping unionization from going forward things that we're working on addressing one of the major ones is that if you're already overworked you're probably not going to have a lot of free time to go to union meetings we're doing good work but it is work and a lot of people do not have the emotional energy for that especially after working in an industry where the conditions aren't that great another barrier that we get from people is kind of a general fear of unionism is a concept it's why most of the time when we're talking to people we don't say would you like to form a union we say man this thing that's happening sucks we should do something about this we should talk to other people about it we should try and get our co-workers together but I think the core of it really is that people have this idea that this is a passion based industry and we don't really need worker protections because we're all very excited to be here and we all are you know we're making video games it's a dream job and that means that people are hesitant to invest time and effort in something that they feel could make it less exciting to work on ultimately the message that we've been trying to push is that better labor makes for better games that idea that the poor labor standards don't affect you personally there's something that's pretty pervasive culturally like I didn't you know thinking about where our clothes come from is already pretty uncomfortable and most people will end to deal with that cognitive dissonance and not really do anything about it from an empathetic perspective you should probably care about how the things you buy get made and we need to treat our workers with dignity and respect as of a couple of years ago the video game industry has about 65,000 employees that's not the largest sector of the economy but it's still a pretty substantial one and a lot of these jobs are very similar to technology jobs especially for programmers like myself and how we define what the labor practices of these new industries like video games and technology are going to look like is going to be really important going forward as more and more technology focused jobs emerge basically these are sectors of the economy that aren't unionized and as a result they often get the most exploited I think if we figure this out now that's really important because it only gets harder the longer they go with these unfair practices the longer they go treating their workers like they don't matter so there you go this isn't just about morality this is about economics as well when an industry is able to invest in their labor their products will be better and they'll make more money when we all do better we all do better go to game workers unite org click
