 Hello Guardian columnist Jonathan Friedland here. 2022 is a very busy year for American politics and we think it's about time that we got our own podcast where our wonderful listeners can go to hear me discuss the latest news from Washington and beyond with the best experts around. So from Friday February 25th search for Politics Weekly America on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
