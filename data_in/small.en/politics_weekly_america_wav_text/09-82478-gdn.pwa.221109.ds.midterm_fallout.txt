 This is The Guardian. It's the morning after the night before and at this hour Democrats are looking likely to lose the House of Representatives, not guaranteed, and if they do the margin seems to be very, very slim. If their luck holds, Democrats look set to keep hold of the Senate, not least because they gained a Senate seat after John Fetterman beat the odds and defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. All very provisional, hedged and contingent because obviously results are still coming in even as we speak to you 12 hours after our last podcast. So where does all this leave Democrats and Republicans as 2024 looms? Is this perhaps the turning point for Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party? And does everyone know Joe Biden? An apology. I'm Guardian columnist Jonathan Friedland and this is a special edition of Politics Weekly American. The word is that Donald Trump is said to be furious without how his hand-picked candidates performed last night. A lot of them did very badly, but Republicans can be happy with the wipeout they inflicted in Florida and the fact that they are still in the hunt for Senate seats in Georgia and in Nevada and for the governor's race in Arizona. And if they were to win those two Senate seats they would actually take control of the Senate on top of what we're expecting to be a very narrow win in the House. So I'm in a studio in Washington DC. Alongside me is my colleague the senior political reporter for Guardian US, Lauren Gambino. Hi Lauren. Hello. And on the line Tara Setmire who is a former communications director for a Republican member of Congress. Hi Tara. Hello. And completing our panel of wise gurus David Shaw political analyst and strategist sought out by Democrats. Hi David Shaw. Hey. Good to have you all with us. Let's start off with this assumption and I've you know hedged it carefully because we still don't know. But if the Republicans do win the House of Representatives even if it's narrow, Tara Setmire what do you think they then do with it? Well I have to say that many of us in the Pundentry class did not expect the election results to be as close given the historical headwinds facing the Democrats as it has ultimately become. I as someone who works very hard on defending democracy, working with the Lincoln Project and and others who are were very concerned about the direction the Republican Party was going in and the type of candidates almost 300 of them who were election deniers on the ballot across the country. We were very concerned about the direction of the political wins here with Republicans potentially winning in offices that could impact our future elections. So far it looks as though democracy had a great night. Although Democrats may still continue to lose the House that slim majority is not necessarily a blessing for Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans who want to appear as though they'd like to govern. We really don't know what the Republican agenda is outside of investigations endlessly against Hunter Biden or impeaching Joe Biden. They didn't really present their their full agenda of how they would combat economic issues and other other issues that are important to the American people. Tara let me just jump in on that very specific thing about investigations because you're absolutely right people anticipated that when they were assuming a big Republican night and big Republican wins. Is it as you're somebody who has worked for the Republican Party on Capitol Hill back in the day is it your guess that even if they squeak it really two or three a handful of seats even in that situation do you think that you would still use the power of being the majority party in the House controlling it to have those hearings and investigations and to go gunning for Joe Biden and Democrats or would they think you know we didn't get such a big mandate let's hold back. I think this is the dilemma the MAGA wing of the Republican Party will demand this that's why the slim majority is so problematic for Kevin McCarthy's hopes of being speaker. I have said for quite some time that I don't believe Kevin McCarthy will ever be the speaker of the House because of the influence of the MAGA portion of the party they run it. There's a reason why Kevin McCarthy when he announced the commitment to America he had Marjorie Taylor Greene standing next to him on the stage. She's the extremely far right congresswoman from Georgia and she represents a contingent a large contingent large enough to be disruptive in the House that they I think Kevin McCarthy would have to make considerable concessions if he thinks he's going to win the speakership in order to get them to vote for him which would be guaranteeing investigations or into Hunter and Joe Biden and others in the Biden administration because that's what the MAGA world wants. So no I don't see them actually governing effectively because he cannot control the MAGA wing of the party. We've had her Tara on the Republicans. Dave it must bring you in on the Democrats. As Tara said expectations were for something very different for a big red wave. Democrats were quoted in all the papers and all and everywhere else saying they were bracing themselves as if a hurricane was coming. First of all tell us if you share in that surprise or if you perhaps were were expecting something more like this and what's your account for why it happened the way it happened. Well you know I think you would all say is that if you compare to the public polls this is something of a surprise but not really that inconsistent with what aggregators were saying. You know what has happened is that in the past week before the election a lot of people put out very conservative polls. I think a lot of pollsters were very nervous and doing what they can to you know lower their numbers. But I think while this is a surprise I don't think that this is out of the ordinary. I think just to deconstruct what happened I think the most interesting part of this is if you look at the data both the early vote data the exit polls and also just looking at the some county level election results it's really clear that this was not a turnout story. The 2022 electorate from what we can tell and to be clear it's still early in our country it takes a long time to count votes. It really seems like Republicans turned out at a considerably higher rate than Democrats. This was an electorate where more people identified as Republican than Democratic than Democrat and yet Democratic can't it's won anyway because they were able to persuade independents and persuade Republicans to actually vote for them. And I think that that that's the super interesting story of the cycle at least from what we can see so far. Now that's completely fascinating. Well I'm bound to put this to you. We had Chris Scott on the podcast 12 hours ago from the progressive wing of the party and he suggested this was a good night specifically for progressives. It was because the candidates from the left he thought he made a case that they had flourished more and then he held up the example that's of Tim Ryan in Ohio being on the other side of that argument and losing out to J.D Vance there. You've explained on this podcast before and made a big impact in the Democratic party for making a different kind of case saying that Democrats needed to shed some of those and it's a crude shorthand but some of those sort of woke culture war issues and to tack further towards the center if they were to win. Within that argument what do you think last night's evidence tells you? You know I think that the Democratic party this cycle really ran on the right things. They ran good ads. If you actually go and listen to any speeches by Democratic candidates or watch any ads that candidates like Betterman put on they talked about abortion. They talked about jobs. They talked about cost of living. There was really an incredible amount of message discipline this cycle and that was also followed up with large amounts of money. Democrats heavily outspent Republicans and governors races and also to a similar extent in Senate races as well. And the ads that they put on were about the right subjects. I think even if you look at candidates with a left-wing history like Betterman, he was very clear in saying that he didn't support defund the police. There were actually tons of candidates in swing states who put out candidates ads that made that clear. And when it came to what they actually said to voters they focused on the issues that people agreed with them on which was you know abortion and health care and other bread and butter issues that people care about. Because that's always been your message Democrats should talk about issues where people agree with them and so you're saying they did that there. Just on that point Lauren and Gambino sitting next to me here in Washington DC. When people thought this was going to go very badly for Democrats when it was the pre-mortem because in the end it doesn't need to be a post-mortem. They were saying maybe we made a mistake talking about stuff like abortion and the threat to democracy. Maybe we needed to go much harder on bread and butter issues about the economy etc. Is it your sense that actually going on those other things you know the president making a big speech about democracy just a few days ago in the final stretch of the campaign maybe that worked? There are definitely signs that voters were furious over the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. I mean we even saw in reliably read Kentucky a decision to protect abortion rights there or to vote against an initiative to roll back abortion rights. Because there was a kind of referendum in Kentucky. Exactly. It was specifically on abortion. Exactly. We also saw I mean I think if you look at Michigan that's probably the best case. Michigan just up and down the ballots. Democrats won. They even surprised themselves by taking control of the state senate and House so you know trifecta because they also won the governorship and their abortion was on the ballot. The right to try and abortion rights their constitution and so clearly this was an issue that brought people out and brought people out for Democrats. I also think you know we still have some key races where very high profile election deniers as we call them are you know in the running still Arizona being a key place to look for that in the governor's race. Carrie Lake is only trailing by just less than a percentage point. And she is a big time election denier. She's like a sort of Trump figure isn't she? She's a very Trumpian figure you know has been talked about as maybe potentially even a running mate for Trump in 2024 and she is someone who has said you know wouldn't say whether she would accept the results of this year's election. But when you look broadly you look at Pennsylvania the governor's race there I think you know some where the Democrat beat back a really really extreme sort of Christian nationalist election denier who was at the Capitol on January 6th. I do think you see a thread of election deniers being beat back and I think you'll see from the White House a sense of you know vindication that they said multiple times that they said vindication that they said multiple times democracy is on the ballot they argued that and I think they will take from these results that people rose to the occasion. So Tara just on the I mean that almost back of the envelope analysis would say this was a year that Republicans should have won by the laws of normal political gravity because it's a midterm election and the incumbent party normally loses economies in a bad state everything would have said Republicans would win but it was because of those positions on abortion and on democracy that somehow what would the normal laws of political gravity were suspended and either prevented Republicans winning or actually in some cases allowed Democrats to win. Absolutely you know I've been in politics a long time and candidate quality matters and it's pretty remarkable that given the political headwinds and history as you mentioned where a sitting party has only gained seats three times in the last 80 years that a sitting party with a president that's in the low 40s in popularity with inflation where it is that they would not have an overwhelming majority in at least the House that that didn't happen this time and a lot of that I will attribute to the fact that although he was not on the ballot Donald Trump was very much front and center in the minds of voters I believe looking at the reminded of the chaos and of the out of step positions that a lot of his endorsed candidates were taking and I think also the we cannot understate the absolute earthquake political earthquake that the Dobbs decision created in this country that would never in the history of America has a right been taken away and that's what happened with the overturning of Roe Roe v Wade and it mobilized younger voters Gen Z voters and women across the political spectrum as we continue to look at and analyze the numbers of turnout in turnout I think you're going to see in the suburban districts swing districts that that that that women will be will have been the difference suburban women because they did not feel that the Republican position on abortion was something that was palatable right I'm going to come back into you in a second Tara about what the implications are of that for Trump in specifically and whether or not there's such a sort of Trump albatross now that whether they're going to have to somehow cast him off I want to come back to that but just before we do David if you buy this my back of the envelope point there that it's basically abortion rights and the democratic threat that allow Democrats either to advance or at least to hold back the wave this time what does that mean for a sort of as it were permanent or ongoing strategy I can see how it worked this one time November 2022 but you're somebody who's thinking deep into the future about how the where the Democrats should be positioned there isn't a sort of long term strategy here for Democrats or is there you know I think that the Dobbs decision absolutely was instrumental in this election result you know what we do something that we try we track is just what party do you trust more on various different issues and you know what you generally see is people trust Democrats on healthcare they trust Republicans on crime and immigration and abortion really up until very recently was a pretty neutral issue for Democrats that didn't mean it was bad but it wasn't necessarily like a vote-getter in most of the country but after the Dobbs decision it abortion shifted from being you know basically average of the 33 message issues that we tested to becoming basically the single best issue for Democrats and the extent to which voters cared about abortion also skyrocketed out of the 33 message issue areas that we track abortion went from being the 30th out of 33 most important issue to being like the 12th basically overnight I think when it comes to democracy the story is unfortunately a bit more complex you know I every time that we've done testing whether it's on ads or whether it's on talking points you know a lot of Democratic rhetoric on democracy even though I personally think it's a very important issue kind of falls flat I think you know a lot of this depends on what the Republican Party decides to do I'm I'm not an expert on intro GOP politics but something that I find very interesting is that both Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis in contrast to basically every other well-known Republican in the country have actually staked a relatively moderate stance on abortion at least relative to other Republicans and I personally find it interesting and puzzling that you know Republican activists haven't haven't pummeled them for this or haven't attacked them and I think the big question is is the GOP going to continue to take these very unpopular stances or are they going to change course in response to these elections and you know that's something that's just hard to know I don't know the answer to that but I think that's what I'm I will let's say let's I think that is the fascinating question do they in some way pull back in the light of these results and I hadn't picked up that if very interesting specific about Ron DeSantis on abortion let's just hear you first on that question whether the Republicans pull back Lauren and then I want to hear you on it Tara as somebody who has obviously lived and breathed and worked with Republicans on just these sort of issues Lauren first um thank you I yeah I think that's a really really interesting point and we saw a lot of the candidates who staked out the furthest sort of most extreme positions on abortion like I already mentioned in Pennsylvania the governors race Doug Mastriano people who called for you know no exceptions to the to abortion bans even in cases of rape incest life of the mother these kind of Republicans just did not do well again in Michigan the governors race there the Republicans similarly staked out really extreme positions on abortion and she obviously lost and so I think yeah that's clearly a central issue Democrats clearly have the advantage on this issue and perhaps they can keep pushing it but it will definitely be something to monitor as we get towards 2024 I was also thinking something that David said you know a lot of Democrats will say they recognize that talking about democracy itself isn't possibly the most motivating issue but when you connect it but when you emphasize it in terms of extremism in terms of your opponent's you know extremism you could even tie that to abortion which many of them tried to do when you can point out that you're the candidate you're running against is just far outside the mainstream that is a that is a way to sort of emphasize the point even if the idea of democracy is a bit vague for some voters Tara I did pick up it may be you know setting the bar far too low but a slight sign that maybe Republicans got this message in the fact that two or three even of these election denying candidates did concede defeat and so Bouldock in New Hampshire did it quite gracelessly but he did say yes Maggie Hassan for the Democrats has won this contest and I wondered if that was just the first sign I know you know one swallow does not a spring or summer make etc but I wondered if this was the first sign of what David was talking about of Republicans sort of getting the message and thinking we are going to have to shift a little bit away from the far edges of Trump ism you have obviously worked with the people who will be making this these decisions what do you think do you think there comes a sort of ideological cooling down among Republicans as a result of the of this night of results you know one often says that political parties do not course correct until they lose power and this may be the potential opportunity for Republicans to finally look at how much Donald Trump has cost them since he won in 2016 that was the last of it and so you already see the circular firing squads starting with between the magga wing and the gentry Republicans and even though you had a handful of the election deniers who decided to concede well mainly because the elections were so far out of reach for them at that point they couldn't question the results where it's a bit closer which is where it becomes more problematic in places like Arizona we're not seeing concession is Ron DeSantis and his overwhelming win in Florida the answer for them finally some establishment Republicans may think the answer to that is yes I think that they really have no idea whether Ron DeSantis can withstand a full-on full frontal attack by Donald Trump many other more formidable Republicans have withered at the full frontal attack of Donald Trump than Ron DeSantis so that international warfare is something to keep an eye on and it's already developing just pay attention to the different Republican right-wing media ecosystem and see how they're framing this yeah Democrats will be getting the popcorn out for this I know I just have to I have to pick your I just have to put to you one thing because I thought it would might be you may be able to shed some light on this you're absolutely right this battle is about to be joined Trump versus DeSantis and you could see even in the campaign Trump obviously can't stand Ron DeSantis he called him Ron DeSanctimonious in a rally rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania that where I was in the crowd watching him but he threatened him saying look if he did run I will tell you things about him that won't be very flattering I know more about him than anybody other anybody else than perhaps his wife who is really running his campaign so Ron DeSantis is going to be feeling very strong a lot of people are going to be looking at him that massive win he racked up in Florida but do you have any sense of what Donald Trump has got in mind is he just being is he bluffing or is there something is there something skeletal in the cupboard that Ron DeSantis has to worry about that Donald Trump knows about oh he's not bluffing Ron DeSantis does have things to worry about and those all of those skeletons come out of the closet when you run for president and I can tell you right now that for the last year or so as more and more rumblings of a Ron DeSantis challenge to Donald Trump became audible they've been preparing to take him out so that's what I'm saying whether he can withstand that once he's under the full lights of of scrutiny coming from Trump world which it has no problems going after people no shame whatsoever we've already seen this I'm not so sure that DeSantis can withstand that whether whether the field is cleared for Donald Trump is up in the air at this point now because they didn't get the red wave he's poised to announce on the 15th reports are that the inner circle is asking him maybe you should delay that and he's he's pushing back quite angrily saying that would make him look weak and wounded if he did so so this is something to keep an eye on it's developing very much David on the democratic side of the line there were lots of democrats who thought if there is going to mix my meteorological metaphors here if there is a red wave then the the that thundercloud of defeat would have at least a silver lining for democrats because it would enable them to say what is in some ways the unsayable which is to joe biden look you're going to turn 80 uh you would be 82 um you know for the next election maybe it's time to think about someone else from your because you talk to voters you do focus grouping you do you study the numbers biden's people in the white house using the word vindicated about these results where do you think he stands what would be best for democrats going into 2024 to run with the man who pulled off this surprise success or to pass the torch to the next generation what are the numbers saying as you see it you know what i would say stepping back probably it's always hard to know who the most selectable person is especially in a presidential race but there are certain fundamentals which is that incumbency is incredibly valuable you know one of the big reasons why democrats were have been able to do as well as they have and both the senate and the house and our leaning districts is because voters knew who they were even if you know six months ago their favorability ratings might not have been very good there's definitely a case that it would make sense to avoid a bruising trillion dollar primary where all of the smartest minds in the democratic party devote themselves into driving the favorables down of all of our favorite candidates and so from that perspective i think a lot of folks a lot of insiders are kind of rooting for there to not be a big bruising primary the one empirical point i'll make is that there's been something very different about the viden presidency than the trump presidency or even the obama presidency which is that you know the traditional the traditional pattern of american politics was that there was this really strong relationship between economic conditions and presidential approval and you know that was true for clinton it was true for bush but it stopped being true for barack obama and for uh donald trump but it's come back for joe biden and so i think ultimately the question of 2024 is really just what the economy ends up being and it's not because i would have thought that almost regardless of all the other indicators and i'm sorry to be just brutal but just biden's age would be an almost decisive fact i see that the exit polling did voters as they came out from voting yesterday when asked other questions said one of them was that they didn't think joe biden should run again i think that was something even among people who are well disposed to the democrats lauren for you talk to people on all sides in this well what is the feeling about joe biden running again now it would for all the reasons david said it will now i think if he wants to he'll be able to there won't be pressure on him because he's come out of this something of a winner but what do you think what do you hear you know if you look at his approvals uh within the democratic party he he still has support he definitely has support and um i think at least in the past few months it does seem like there's been a shift towards accepting or preparing for a biden reelection campaign among you know democratic strategists there seems less of an appetite to have someone else run for all the reasons david just laid out because it would be messy because they're hoping republicans are the ones that everyone you know that they have the messy primary that everyone's glued to it's also not clear who would be the obvious successor you you think that it might be vice president kamala harris but um there you know there's just a lot of questions about who would be the obvious uh alternative to joe biden but age is certainly a factor if he were to end up running against someone like ron de santis who you know just by comparison you'd see them on stage ron senses much younger um i mean this election cycle was so volatile so much happened and just you know like 18 months that i couldn't even begin to predict all of the factors that would influence 2024 so so you know who knows what that fight would look like between biden and trump or biden and desantis or another democrat and either of them or anyone really uh there's just it's a very volatile time i think um in american politics as we've just seen it absolutely is tara's that mine i know we're gonna have to lose you in a second but before we do i know you probably are not often advising republicans these days but if you were what would be your advice to them in the light of these results well my advice to republicans uh is consistent it's stop with the it would stop hitching your wagon to people who are unqualified to run for office for people who are dangerous to democracy and who are willing to engage in illiberal extrajudicial unconstitutional means to maintain power that was never the republican brand until donald trump came into into play and what they have sacrificed has cost them greatly as far as um reputation as far as the democracy and the stability in this country political violence and it has not been a positive path for them so um if they if there's any opportunity to to course correct and rehabilitate the republican party brand now is the time to do that and fully reject magga they're not going to listen and and it's uh it's clear that um the malignancy of trumpism has infected the party and i'm not quite sure that they have the leadership and the wherewithal to actually beat it back but we'll see same question for you david sure if you're advising and i know you do democrats and democratic candidates what's your advice to them based on what we've seen these last 24 hours uh you know what i would just say is that uh democrats showed an enormous amount of discipline uh this cycle in talking about things that people cared about capitalizing on the mistakes that republicans made and keeping the conversation uh on issues that folks agree with us on and i think the simple answer is that we have to keep doing that and make sure that we continue to nominate good candidates and uh not get distracted and i i think that it's as simple as that lauren a closing thought from you what's your big takeaway i know there's so many but one big takeaway from these remarkable 24 hours well i'm just going forward i'm really curious to see how you know kevin mccarthy or perhaps another republican leader who might emerge as as the house speaker i'm just curious to see what they propose as a governing agenda if they try to govern because i think um i think maybe david mentioned this but if if we see just a slew of investigations and you know a lot of attacks on biden that don't seem to address the very real problems that we have in this country that could set joe biden up for a pretty easy contrast in 2024 he could come out saying look you gave them power and look what they did with it absolutely nothing um and so you know at least with two years in office the democrats have notched some legislative achievements and including some bipartisan wins so i think you know if they really try to just sort of double down on the the maga wing and double down on on the investigations and the attacks on biden maybe biden comes out the victor you know i've heard one expert today saying that midterms are a notoriously bad predictor of the following presidential election people who have lost like obama or clinton have then gone on to win presidential elections but i hadn't thought of this that even people who've done quite well in midterms jimmy carter did quite well george herbert walker bush did quite well then went on to lose so it's not guaranteed at all that this relatively good night for democrats necessarily portends a triumph in 2024 thank you all so much for your expert view even though i think between us there's probably only about four or five hours sleep in this sleep deprived state my thanks to lauren gambino taurus etm and david shaw this brings to an end our special midterm election coverage we do of course still have georgia to look out for that could be a runoff which will keep us busy right into december and there will be lots of other races still not yet decided to talk about and pick over uh next week our thanks to the producer daniel stevens the executive producer is maz eptahaj i'm jonathan freeland i will be back with politics weekly america next friday november the 18th but thank you as always for listening
