Extract the Argument Graph Units (AGUs) from this podcast text.

- An AGU is defined as : Argument Unit (AU) and unique handles.
- An AU is defined as : an AU can be a Main claim, premise (support for main claim), counterargument (attack on main claim), and rebuttal (challenging premise or counterargument). The AU is synthesized from the input text
- A handle is defined as : string quote from the input text, which can be used to find and verify the text from which the AU was synthesized.

Building the Argument graph:

- The argument graph has only one Main claim
- Each AU is unique to itâ€™s category, and does not repeat
- Try extracting AGUs even if the conversation is informal
- the Argument graph will be structured as follows:

START
Main claim AGU

- text (handle: "...)

Premise AGUs

- text (handle: "...)
- ...

Counterargument AGUs

- text (handle: "...)
- ...
Rebuttal AGUs
- text (handle: "...)
- ...
